Q4 2024 Earnings Call

Presentation
`Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2024 Q&A Webcast. My
name is `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations, the Head of Investor Relations here at Tesla, and I am joined today by
`Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer and `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced
at about 3 p.m. Central Time, in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These
comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results
could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in
our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call,
please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join
the question queue.
Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
`Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you. So in summary, in Q4, we set a record and delivered vehicles at an annualized rate of
nearly 2 million a year. So congratulations to the Tesla team on excellent work, achieving record
production and deliveries. Model Y was the best-selling vehicle of any kind for 2024. That's worth
noting. Not just the best electric vehicle, the best vehicle of any kind on earth, number one, was
Model Y.
We're staying focused on maximizing volumes and obviously doubling down, I don't know what --
really, actually, I was going to say doubling down on autonomy, but really, it's like -- autonomy is
like 10x-ing things, frankly. Doubling is not even enough. We made many critical investments in
2024 in manufacturing AI and robotics that will bear immense fruit in the future, immense. Like it's
-- in fact, to such a scale that it is difficult to comprehend. And I've said this before, and I'll stand
by it. I see a path, I'm not saying it's an easy path, but I see a path to Tesla being the most
valuable company in the world by far. Not even close. Like not -- maybe several times more than -
- I mean, there is a path where Tesla is worth more than the next top five companies combined.
There's a path to that. I mean, I think it's like an incredibly, just like a difficult path, but it is anSo -- and that is overwhelmingly due to autonomous vehicles and autonomous humanoid robots.
So our focus is actually building towards that. And then that's what we're laying the groundwork --
we're laying the groundwork for that in 2024, we'll continue to lay the groundwork for that in
2025, but more than lay the groundwork actually, so we'd be building the structure, we're
building the manufacturing lines, and yes. I'd like -- setting up for what I think will be an epic 2026
and a ridiculous '27 and '28, ridiculously good. That is my prediction.
As yet, very few people understand the value of full self-driving and our ability to monetize the
fleet. Some of these things I've said for quite a long time, and I know people have said, well, Elon
is the boy who cried wolf like several times, but I'm telling you, there's a damn wolf at this time,
and you can drive it. In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf. For a lot of people, like their
experience of Tesla autonomy is like, if it's even a year old, if it's even two years old, it's like
meeting someone when they're like a toddler and thinking that they're going to be a toddler
forever. But obviously, they're not going to be a toddler forever, they grow up. But if their last
experience was like, oh, FSD was a toddler, it's like, well, it's grown up now. Have you seen it? It's
like walks and talks. And that's really what we've got.
And it's difficult to -- for people to understand this because human intuition is linear as opposed
to what we're seeing is exponential progress. So that's why my number one recommendation for
anyone who doubts is simply try it. Have you tried it? When was the last time you tried it? And the
only people who are skeptical, the only people who are skeptical are those who have not tried it.
So a car goes -- a passenger car typically has only about 10 hours of utility per week out of 168, a
very small percentage. Once that car is autonomous, my rough estimate is that it is in use for at
least a third of the hours per week, so call it, 50, maybe 55 hours of the week. And it can be
useful both, cargo delivery and people delivery.
So even let's say people are asleep, but you can deliver packages in the middle of the night, or
resupply restaurants, or whatever the case may be, whatever people need at all hours of the day
or night. That same asset -- the thing that -- these things that already exist with no incremental
cost change, just a software update, now have 5x or more the utility than they currently have. I
think this will be the largest asset value increase in human history. Maybe there's something
bigger, but I just don't know what it is.
And so people who look in the rearview mirror are looking for past precedent, except I don't
think there is one. So like -- but like the reality of autonomy is upon us, and I repeat my advice, try
driving the car or let it drive you. So now, it works very well in the U.S., of course, it will over time
work just as well everywhere else. Yes. So we're working hard to grow our annual volumes. Our
constraint -- our current constraint is battery packs this year, but we're working on addressing that
constraint, and I think we will make progress in addressing that constraint. And then things are
really going to go ballistic next year, and really ballistic in '27 and '28.
So yes. So look, a bit more on full self-driving. Our Q4 vehicle safety report shows continued year-
over-year improvements in safety for vehicles, so that the safety numbers, if somebody has
supervised full self-driving turned on or not, the safety differences are gigantic. So -- and people
have seen the immense improvement with version 13 and with incremental versions in version 13,
and then version 14 is going to be yet another step beyond that, that is very significant.
We launched the Cortex training cluster at Gigafactory Austin, which was a significant contributor
to FSD advancement, and we continue to invest in training infrastructure out of Texas
headquarters. So the training needs for Optimus or Optimus humanoid robot are probably at
least ultimately 10x what's needed for the car, at least to get to the full range of useful roles. You
can see, like, how many different roles are there for a humanoid robot versus a car. A humanoidrobot has probably 1,000x more uses and more complex things than in a car. That doesn't mean
the training scales by 1,000 but it's probably 10x.
Now, you can do this progressively, so it doesn't mean Tesla is going to spend $500 billion in
training compute because we will obviously train Optimus to do enough tasks to match the
output of Optimus robots. And obviously, the cost of training is dropping dramatically with time.
So -- but it is -- like, it is one of those things where I think long-term Optimus will be -- Optimus
has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue. Like, it's really bananas. So you can
obviously afford a lot of training compute in that situation. In fact, even $500 billion training
compute in that situation would be quite a good deal.
Yes. The future is going to be incredibly different from the past, that's for sure. We live at this
unbelievable inflection point in human history. So yes. So the proof is in the pudding. So we're
going to be launching unsupervised full self-driving as a paid service in Austin in June. So I've
talked with the team. We feel confident in being able to do an initial launch of unsupervised no
one in the car, full self-driving in Austin in June. We already have Teslas operating autonomously,
unsupervised, full self-driving at our factory in Fremont, and we'll soon be doing that at our
factory in Texas. So thousands of cars every day are driving with no one in them at our Fremont
factory in California. They will soon be doing that in Austin and then elsewhere in the world at the
rest of our factories, which is pretty cool.
And the cars aren't just driving to exactly the same spot because obviously they don't all want to
collide at the same spot. The cars are actually programmed with what lane they need to park into
to be picked up for delivery. So they drive from the factory end of line to their destination parking
spot and to be picked up for delivery to customers. And then doing this reliably every day,
thousands of times a day. It's pretty cool. Like I said, the Teslas will be in the wild with no one in
them in June in Austin.
So what I'm saying is this is not some far-off mythical situation. It's literally five, six months away,
five months away kind of thing. And while we're stepping into -- putting our toe in the water
gently at first, just to make sure everything is cool, our solution is a sort of -- our solution is a
generalized AI solution. It does not require high-precision maps of a locality. So we just want to be
cautious. It's not that it doesn't work beyond Austin. In fact, it does. We just want to put a toe in
the water, make sure everything is okay, then put a few more toes in the water, then put a foot in
the water with safety of the general public as -- and those in the car as our top priority.
With regard to Optimus, obviously, I'm making these revenue predictions that sound absolutely
insane. I realize that. But I think they will prove to be accurate. Now, with Optimus, there's a lot of
uncertainty on the exact timing because it's not like a train arriving at the station for Optimus. We
are designing the train and the station and in real time while also building the tracks. And so
they're like, people can say, why didn't the train arrive exactly at 12.05? I'm like, we're literally
designing the train and the tracks and the station in real time. While -- so like how can we predict
this thing with absolute precision? It's impossible.
The normal internal plan calls for roughly 10,000 Optimus robots to be built this year. Will we
succeed in building 10,000 exactly by the end of December this year? Probably not. But will we
succeed in making several thousand? Yes, I think we will. Will those several thousand Optimus
robots be doing useful things by the end of the year? Yes, I'm confident they will do useful things.
Those Optimus in use at the Tesla factories for production design one will inform how would we
change for production design two, which we expect to launch next year. And our goal is to ramp
up Optimus production faster than maybe anything has ever been ramped. Meaning like,aspirationally, an order of magnitude ramp per year. Now if we aspire to an order of magnitude
ramp per year, perhaps we only end up with a half order of magnitude per year. But that's the
kind of growth that we're talking about. It doesn't take very many years before we're making a
100 million of these things a year. If you go up by, let's say, a factor by 5x per year.
`Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
Insane.
`Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Insane. Not 50%, 500%. So, yes, these are big growth numbers. Yes. But we do need to -- this is
an entirely new supply chain. It's entirely new technology. There's nothing off the shelf to use. We
tried desperately with Optimus to use any existing motors, any actuators, sensors, nothing
worked for a humanoid robot at any price. We had to design everything from physics first
principles to work for a humanoid robot. And with the most sophisticated hand that has ever
been made before, by far. Optimus will be able to, like, play the piano and be able to thread a
needle. I mean, this is the level of precision no one has been able to achieve. And so, it's really
something special.
So -- yes. So -- and my prediction long-term is that Optimus will be overwhelmingly the value of
the company. Regarding energy, back to earth. Earth Elon. Can you come back here for a minute?
Okay, back to earth. Energy storage is a big deal and will become -- it's already super important,
will become incredibly important in the future. And it is something that enables far greater energy
output to the grid than is currently possible, because the grid -- the vast majority of the grid has
no energy storage capability. So they have to design the power plants to -- for very high peaks
and assuming that there's no energy storage. Once you have grid energy storage and home-
based energy storage, the actual total energy output per year of the grid is dramatically greater
than people think. Maybe it's at least double. This will drive the demand of stationary battery
packs, and especially, the grid-scale ones to an insane -- basically, as much demand as we could
possibly make.
So we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that's starting operation, and we're building
a third factory. So we're trying to ramp the output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as
possible. Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful, too, that we're not robbing
from one pocket to take to another pocket, because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the
cell output, we have to say, well, does it go into stationary applications or mobile applications? It
can't go both -- into both. So we have to make that trade-off.
Yes. But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary,
that will grow in a very, very big way over time. So in conclusion, 2025 really is a pivotal year for
Tesla. And when people look back on 2025 and the launch of unsupervised full self-driving, true
real-world AI that actually works, I think they may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history,
maybe even bigger than our first car, the Roadster or the Model S or the Model 3 or Model Y. In
fact, I think it probably will be viewed, '25, as maybe the most important year in Tesla's history.
There is no company in the world that is as good at real-world AI as Tesla. I don't even know who
is in second place. Like, you say, like, who is in second place for real-world AI? I would need a very
big telescope to see them. That's how far behind they are. All right.
`Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much, Elon. And Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.`Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
Yes. I'll talk about things on earth. As Elon mentioned, in Q4, we set records in vehicle deliveries
and energy storage deployments in an uncertain macroenvironment. We were able to grow auto
and energy storage volumes both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis. For this, I would like
to thank the efforts of everyone at Tesla to make this a reality and our customers who helped us
achieve this feat.
Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive
business. And we accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good
inventory in the last two years. This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options,
but also other discounts and programs, which impacted ASPs. While we saw volume growth in
almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the Greater China
market. This is an encouraging trend, since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market.
On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline, primarily due to lower
ASPs and due to the recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases. Our journey
on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below
$35,000, driven primarily by material costs. This was despite increased depreciation and other
costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y, for which we recently started taking
orders in all markets. All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month. While we
feel confident in our team's abilities to ramp production quickly, know that it is an unprecedented
change and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and
updating all factories at the same time.
This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter. As a result, margins
will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch,
but will be overcome as production is ramped. We will be introducing several new products
throughout 2025. We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of 2025,
and we'll continue to expand our lineup from there. On a dollar-for-dollar basis, we believe we
have the most compelling lineup today compared to the industry, and it will continue to get
better from here. As always, all our products come with the best software in the industry,
autonomy features, and capable of full autonomy in the future. And despite the premium
experience, the total cost of ownership is close to mass market, less premium competitors.
Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q4, and resulted in -- but declined
sequentially. This was a result of higher -- sorry, growth came from Megapack and Powerwall. Both
businesses continue to be supply-constrained, and like Elon mentioned, we're trying to ramp up
production with Megafactory Shanghai coming online this quarter onwards. While quarterly
deployments will likely continue to fluctuate sequentially, we expect at least 50% growth in
deployments year-over-year in 2025.
Gross profit and margins in the service and other business was up year-over-year, but declined
sequentially. This was a result of higher service center costs and lower profit from used car
business. The businesses within service and other primarily support our new car business,
especially through their impact on total cost of ownership Therefore, while we manage them to
be positive on a GAAP basis, we do not expect similar margins as the rest of the business.
There's a lot of uncertainty around tariffs. Over the years, we've tried to localize our supply chain
in every market, but we are still very reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses.
Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, and any reciprocity will have an impact on
our business and profitability. Our operating expenses grew both year-over-year and sequentially,the biggest driver of the increase was R&D as we continue to invest in AI-related initiatives. The
remaining increase came from growth in our sales capabilities and marketing efforts from referral
program. For 2025, we expect operating expenses to increase to support our growth initiatives. It
is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $600 million mark-to-
market benefit from Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets,
whereby we will take mark-to-market adjustments through other income every reporting period
going forward.
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and despite CapEx increase of over $2.4 billion
in 2024, we were able to generate free cash flow of $3.6 billion for the year. CapEx efficiency is
something we are extremely focused on. While we have invested in AI-related initiatives, we have
done so in a very targeted manner to utilize the spend to get immediate benefits. The build-out
of Cortex was accelerated because of the role -- well, actually, accelerate the rollout of FSD v --
version 13. A cumulative AI-related CapEx, including infrastructure, so far has been approximately
$5 billion. And for 2025, we expect our CapEx to be flat on a year-over-year basis.
In conclusion, like Elon said, 2025 is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla. There are a lot of
investments which we have made and will continue to make in this coming year, which will set the
pace for the next phase of growth. And it is something which now I'm getting out of earth, it is
going to be out of this world. And we just are putting the right foundation. And that's all I have.
Questions And Answers
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
(Question And Answer)
Great. Thank you very much, Vaibhav. Now we will move over to investor questions, and we'll start
with say.com. The first question is, is unsupervised FSD still planned to be released in Texas and
California this year? What hurdles still exist to make that happen? You addressed the Texas
piece, I think, already, so.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, I'm confident that we will release unsupervised FSD in California this year as well. Yes. In fact,
I think we will at most likely release unsupervised FSD in many regions of the country of the U.S.
by the end of this year. Like I said, we're just putting a toe in the water, then a few toes, then a
foot, then a leg, then make sure everything is cool. And we're looking for a safety level that is
significantly above the average human driver. So it's not anywhere, like much safer -- not like a
little bit safer than human, way safer than human. So the standard has to be very high, because
the moment there's any kind of accident with an autonomous car, this immediately gets
worldwide headlines, even though about 40,000 people die every year in car accidents in the
U.S., and most of them don't even get a mention anywhere. But if somebody scrapes on skin with
an autonomous car, it's headline news.
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
We want to avoid that.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. So it's really from an -- the only thing holding us back is an excess of caution. But people can
suddenly get a feel for how well the car would perform as unsupervised FSD by simply having aintervene, not where you wanted to intervene or were a little concerned, but how many times did
you have to intervene for definite safety reasons. And you will find that, that is currently very rare,
and over time, almost never.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, are there any discussions with other auto
companies about licensing FSD?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. What we're seeing is, at this point, significant interest from a number of major car companies
about licensing Tesla full self-driving technology. What we've generally said is the best way to
know what to do is take one of our cars apart, and then you can see where the placement of the
cameras are, what the thermal needs are of the Tesla AI inference computer. That's better than
us sending some cat drawings. And then we're only going to entertain situations where the
volume would be very high. Otherwise, it's just not worth the complexity. And we will not burden
our engineering team with laborious discussions with other engineering teams until we obviously
have unsupervised full self-driving working throughout the United States. I think the interest level
from other manufacturers to license an FSD will be extremely high once it is obvious that unless
you have FSD, you're dead.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, is Optimus now mostly design locked for 2025
production?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Optimus is not design locked. So when I say, like, we're designing the train as it's going to --
we're redesigning the train as it's going down the tracks while redesigning the tracks and the
train stations.
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
Yes. It is evolving, yes.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, it's rapidly evolving. It's rapidly evolving in a good direction. It's pretty, pretty damn amazing
actually, the team is doing a fantastic job. We really have by far -- I think, by far the best team of
humanoid robotics engineers in the world. And we also have all the other ingredients necessary
because you need a great battery pack, you need great power electronics, you need a great
charging capability, you need a great communications, got to have Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity.
And of course, you need real world AI. And then the ability to scale that production to huge
levels, so you have to design for manufacturing. The things that -- I mean really what other
companies are missing is they're missing the real world AI and they're missing the ability to scale
manufacturing 2 millions of units a year.
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
I think that is an underappreciated thing that industrialization of design is a whole different thing
than making a design.A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, prototypes are trivial, basically. Prototypes are easy, production is hard. I've said that for
many years. The problem is that there's, like, those have never been involved in production or
manufacturing somehow think that may -- once you come up with some Eureka design that you
magically can make 1 million units a year. And this is totally false. There needs to be some --
there's some Hollywood story or where they show actually the problem is manufacturing.
I never even heard of one is, it just doesn't fit the narrative. The Hollywood thing is like, it's like
some lone inventor in a garage goes Eureka and suddenly it files a patent, and suddenly there's
millions of units. I'm like, listen, guys, we're missing really 99% of the story. 1% is -- the old saying,
like, a product is 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration. The Hollywood shows you the 1% inspiration
and minus -- but forgets about the 99% perspiration of actually figuring out how to make that
initial prototype manufacturable, and then manufactured at high volume, such as the product is
reliable, low cost, consistent, doesn't break down all the time, and that is 100x harder, at least
than the prototype.
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
Then you have to get it there, deliver it. Yes.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. You're going to read all these regulations and Brazilian regulators around the world, it's very
difficult.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you. The next question is also Optimus related. When will Tesla start selling Optimus
and what will the price be?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Well, for this year, we expect to just close the loop with Optimus being used internally at Tesla
because we obviously can easily use several thousand humanoid robots at Tesla for the most
boring, annoying tasks in the factory, like the tasks nobody wants to do, where we have to, like,
beg people to do this task. And then they -- it's like the robot is totally happy to do the boring,
dangerous, repetitive tasks that no humans want to do. And that's also actually some of the
easiest use cases for us to have Optimus do things like load the hopper -- like, in the body line. If
you're transporting pieces of sheet metal to the -- which is already robot, the robot welding line
for the body, and you just have to non-stop take things out of from one fixture to another fixture,
and it's a very boring job, that's the kind of thing that Optimus could do.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
The guy who runs around and pumps all the weld studs in the bins.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. There's a ton of boring jobs, tedious jobs, slightly dangerous jobs that are perfect for
Optimus. So we expect to use Optimus for those tasks at our factories, and that'll help us close
the loop for improvement this year. It's really with production version 2, which I think launches
sometime next year. I'd like it to be the beginning of next year, but maybe it's more like themiddle of next year. And then we have to do it with a production line that is designed for on the
order of 10,000 units a month versus 1,000 units a month.
So like, when you design a production line for 1,000 units a month, it takes you a while to actually
reach anywhere close to 1,000 units a month. For any given production output, it takes you a
while to actually reach its potential. The current line that we're designing is for roughly 1,000 units
a month of Optimus robots. The next line would be for 10,000 units a month, the line after that
would be for 100,000 units a month.
And I think probably with version 2, that is a very rough guess because there's so much
uncertainty here. Very rough guess that we start delivering Optimus robots to companies that are
outside of Tesla in maybe the second half of next year, something like that. But like, so this is such
an exponential ramp that it'll go from no one is receiving humanoid robots to these things like
coming out like crazy.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
We can't build enough.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
We're always going to be in the we can't build enough situation. Demand will not be a problem,
even at a high price. And then, as I said, like, once we start -- once we're at a steady state of
above 1 million units a year, I think the production -- and I'm confident at 1 million units a year that
the production cost of Optimus will be less than $20,000. If you compare the complexity of
Optimus to the complexity of a car, so just the total mass and complexity of Optimus is much less
than a car. So I would expect that at similar volumes to, say, the Model Y, which is over 1 million
units a year, that you'd see Optimus be, I don't know, half the cost or something like that. What
the price of Optimus is, is a different matter. The price of Optimus will be set by the market
demand.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, what is the status on mass production of the
Tesla Semi, and how will it impact revenue and scale?
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
I can take that one. So we just closed up the Semi factory roof and walls last week in Reno. We
set the schedule, which is great with the weather in Reno. You never know what's going to
happen. But we're prepping for mechanical installation of all the equipment in the coming
months. The first builds of the high-volume Semi design will come late this year in 2025 and begin
ramping early in 2026. But as we've said before, the Semi is a TCO no-brainer, like it's really
similar to the Optimus. It's set by how much people pay, and then as a total cost of ownership,
it's much, much cheaper than any other transportation you can have. So at that point, when we're
at scale, it will meaningfully contribute to Tesla's revenue. Well, I think it's difficult to say how
much. Anything you want to add, Elon?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
No. I mean I do think the Tesla Semi, again, with autonomy, is going to be incredibly valuable. That
we actually have a shortage of truck drivers in America. That's one of the limiting factors on
transport. And people are human, so they get tired sometimes there -- I have a lot of respect forthat want to do it. And this actually -- I believe if my understanding is correct, there are fewer
people entering truck driving as a profession than are leaving it.
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
Yes.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
So when you think, yes, exactly. So when you consider, okay, there's more people leaving truck
driving as a profession than entering it, well, we're going to have a real logistics problem as time
goes by. So autonomy will be very important to meet that need. So like, yes, it'll -- I don't know,
it's a several billion a year opportunity, which I don't know in this context, is that these days does
several billion a year matter? I think it does. It's not nothing. It's probably -- it might, it's probably
like a $10 billion a year thing. Yes, it's $1 billion a month at some point, probably. But it's -- all this is
going to pale in comparison to Optimus. So yes, $1 billion a month is, it's a lot but it's not -- it's
going to be like 1% of Optimus or something.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much. We already covered the next question in opening remarks. So
moving on, is it expected that Tesla will need to upgrade Hardware 3 vehicles? And if so, what is
the timeline and expected impact to Tesla's CapEx? I'm think they're referring to cost in there.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
They're really asking the tough questions all day.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
I guess we raise -- we haven't stopped working on Hardware 3 yet. We are still making software
releases. We released the 12.6 release recently, which was like, it's like a baby v13, but it's a
significant improvement compared to what they had previously. And people are still finding ways
to distill larger models into smaller models. So we're not giving up on Hardware 3, we're still
working on it. Just the releases will trail the Hardware 4 releases.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thanks, Ashok.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. I mean, I think the honest answer is that we're going to have to upgrade people's Hardware
3 computer for those that have bought full self-driving. And that is the honest answer. And that's
going to be painful and difficult, but we'll get it done. Now I'm kind of glad that not that many
people bought the FSD package.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
All right. Thanks, Elon. The next question, has Tesla given up on ramping their solar roof product?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Sorry. Mike, go ahead. Yes.A - `Micheal Snyder, Vice President of Energy and Charging
Yes, I can take it. Yes, solar roof remains a core part of the residential product portfolio and it still
remains where it draws a lot of customer interest despite it being premium products. We've
worked on multiple iterations of engineering to make the product easier to install and distribute
by producing the SKU count. And more recently, rather than direct installation, we are focused on
growth through our nationwide network of certified installers. And many of those, they've been
installing solar roof with us for many years.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. That's actually turned out to be a much better way for the -- like, it's just let the roof -- just
supply product to the roofing industry. And especially when somebody is going to -- is getting a
new roof anyway or building a house from scratch, obviously, this is by far the most efficient time
to put in a solar roof, as opposed to putting a solar roof on a house that -- where the roof still has
20 years' of life. That's not economically sensible, but if it's a new house or the roof needs to be
replaced anyway, then solar roof can make a lot of sense. And it is a premium product, it's like the
-- yes, it's kind of like Model S, Model X or something. It's like -- it's a premium product.
I think it looks really cool. And your house -- I mean your house generates electricity, and if you
combine it with the Tesla Powerwall battery, then you can be self-sufficient. So even if the grid
turns off, even if the grid turns off for several days, your house still works. And your roof looks
awesome. So it's like -- I recommend anyone who can afford it, get the Tesla solar roof and the
Powerwall. Your family's life might depend on it. And just in terms of convenience, your kids are
not going to yell at you because their computers don't work because the power went out and
you can't charge your phone.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
True story.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Actually happens. Yes. You literally can't even call anyone because your phone is out of juice.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Thank you very much. The next question was covered in opening remarks, so we will skip that.
And the last question from say.com, what technical breakthroughs will define V14 of FSD, given
that V13 already covered photon to control?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Well, we've done a hell of a lot further than photons to output. We've been in some of the
nothing but nets situation, nothing but neural nets from photons to controls for a while now.
We're just improving the neural nets. I guess we could get into some of the technical details to
some degree. I have to say, I continue to be amazed by just how effective autoregressive
transformers are at solving a wide range of problems. I mean, Ashok, is there anything you'd like
to add there without giving away the sort of family secrets?
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
I mean, except for things we put on X already. Yes, so continuing to scale the model size a lot. Wemodel size. We're going to increase the context length even more. The memory is sort of limited
right now. We want to increase the amount of memory, also give to even minutes of context for
driving. They're going to add audio in the emergency vehicles better, add like data of the tricky
corner cases that we get from the entire fleet, any interventions, or any kind of like user
intervention. We just add that to the data, the data set. So scaling in basically every access to
training compute, data set size, model size, model context, and also all the reinforcement
learning objectives.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. All righty. With that, we will move over to analyst questions. So just as a reminder, you will
need to unmute yourself to ask your question. And the first question will be coming from Daniel
Roeska from Bernstein. Daniel, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Q - `Daniel Roeska, Bernstein `
Hey, good evening, everybody. It's Daniel from Bernstein. Elon, Tesla's share price clearly already
includes quite a few of the anticipated benefits you talked about today, yet realizing what you call
kind of difficult but achievable will take some time. What are you pushing the Tesla executive
team to do differently now to accelerate the innovation in order to realize the value you
described for the company?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Well, I mean, we're working on perfecting real-world AI and making rapid progress week-over-
week, if not month, something month-over-month but it's often week-over-week. I spend a lot of
time with the Tesla AI team and the Tesla Optimus team. I mean, I go where the problem is,
essentially. Like, not -- if something -- this is -- unfortunately, sometimes I don't talk to a Tesla
executive, they're like, hey, we don't see you very often. I'm like, that's because your stuff is
working awesome. Your stuff is working really great. Unfortunately, I don't see them very often,
because I go where the problem is. So one of the problem is, we're like, what's the greatest
challenge that lies ahead? So obviously, there are many challenges with Optimus. It's how hard
problems are solved. Many challenges with vehicle autonomy. But we're making rapid progress in
both. Yes.
Q - `Daniel Roeska, Bernstein `
Okay. I mean, it sounds like you've got a conviction that the pieces you need, right, are in place.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes.
Q - `Daniel Roeska, Bernstein `
If we kind of go 12 months down the line and we look back, and you had some of those, but
maybe what are the kind of two or three KPIs that would tell you that you're on track and it's
going the right way and the pieces you've put in place are the right pieces, right? That's kind of
what I'm looking for. Or other way around, where would it be off most likely in your mind that you
say, hey, I need to go back there and I need to change something to enable the team better?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `Well, I mean, I think the predictions that I'm making here are going to be pretty accurate. And it's
worth noting sometimes people say, oh, Elon is always late. Well, actually, no, the problem is that
the media reports on when I'm late, but never reports on when I'm early. So sure, I'm optimistic,
but I'm not that optimistic. There are many cases in the past where actually we've been early,
such as completion of the Shanghai factory, or in fact, factory completion has generally been
ahead of schedule, not behind.
So -- yes, so like I said, I'm very confident we'll have released unsupervised full self-driving fully
autonomous Teslas in Austin and several other cities in America by the end of this year. That's
probably everywhere in America next year, and everywhere in North America, at least. I think in
terms of next year, our constraint, I think, it's likely to be just regulatory. Like Europe really has, for
example -- Europe is a layer cake of regulations and bureaucracy, which really needs to be
addressed. There's this joke, like America innovates, Europe regulates. It's like, guys, there's too
many refs on the field.
I mean, for example, for us just to release supervised full self-driving in Europe, even though it
works really well, we have to go through a mountain of paperwork with the Netherlands, which is
our primary regulatory authority. Then the Netherlands presents this to the EU in, I think, May. And
there's like this big EU country committee. We expect it to be approved at that time, but there's
nothing we can do to make that May happen sooner. In fact, nobody seems to do it. I guess all
the countries would have to somehow vote in some way to have it happen sooner than May.
Otherwise, it won't happen sooner than May. So then when is unsupervised FSD allowed in
Europe? I'm like, May next year, maybe? I don't know. We'll have to find out when the EU is
meeting again. Sometimes it's a 12-month cadence, sometimes it's a six-month cadence.
Then China, which is a gigantic market, we do have some challenges because they won't
currently allow us to transfer training video outside of China. And then the U.S. government won't
let us do training in China. So we're in a bit of a bind there, like a bit of a quandary. So what we're
resolving then is by literally looking at videos of streets in China that are available on the Internet
to understand, and then feeding that into our video training so that publicly available video of
street signs and traffic rules in China can be used for training, and then also putting it into a very
accurate simulator. And so it will train using sim for bus lanes in China, like, bus lanes in China, by
the way, one of our biggest challenges in making FSD work in China is the bus lanes are very
complicated, and there's like, literally like, hours of the day that you're allowed to be there and
not be there. And then if you accidentally go in that bus lane at the wrong time, you get an
automatic ticket instantly, so it's kind of a big deal, bus lanes in China.
So we have to put that into our simulator, train on that, the car has to know what time of day it is,
read the sign, and we'll get this solved, but I think we'll have unsupervised FSD in almost every
market this year, limited simply by regulatory issues, not technical capability, and then
unsupervised FSD in the U.S. this year, in many cities, but nationwide next year, and hopefully, we
have unsupervised FSD in most countries by the end of next year. That's my prediction with the
best data that I have right now.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much. The next question will come from `Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley at Morgan Stanley.
Adam, please feel free to unmute yourself.
Q - `Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley `
Thanks, everybody. So Elon, you've said in the past about LiDAR, for EVs at least, that LiDAR is ause it. Do you still feel that way?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes.
Q - `Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley `
Care to elaborate? Or just, I have another question.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Look, we even have a radar in the car, and we turned it off.
Q - `Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley `
I got it. All right. So you're just still -- yes. People think you're crazy as you know, but for not --
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Look, obviously, humans drive without shooting lasers out of their eyes, I mean unless you're
Superman, but like humans drive just with passive visual, humans drive with eyes and a neural net
and a brain neural net, so the biological -- so the digital equivalent of eyes and a brain are
cameras and digital neural nets or AI. So that's -- the entire road system was designed for
passive optical neural nets. That's how the whole world system was designed, and what
everyone is expecting -- that's how we expect other cars to behave. So therefore, that is very
obviously the solution for full self-driving as a generalized. But the generalized solution for full
self-driving as opposed to the very specific neighborhood-by-neighborhood solution which is very
difficult to maintain, which is what our competitors are doing.
Q - `Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley `
Yes, yes.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. Yes.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
I mean, LiDAR doesn't work in the fog, guys.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. LiDAR has a lot of issues. Like, I don't have some like, the SpaceX Dragon docks with the
space station using LiDAR, that -- a program that I personally spearheaded. I don't have some
fundamental bizarre dislike of LiDAR. It's simply the wrong solution for driving cars on roads.
Q - `Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley `
Right. You understand how LiDAR works. I get it.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
We literally designed and built our own LiDAR. I oversaw the project, the engineering of the thing.
It was my decision to use LiDAR on Dragon, and I oversaw that engineering project directly. So I'mlike -- we literally designed and made a LiDAR to dock with the space station. If I thought it was
the right solution for cars, I would do that, but it isn't.
Q - `Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley `
Yes. All right. Just as a follow-up, at CES, you said -- I'm paraphrasing that any -- AI will be able to
do any cognitive task not involving atoms within the next three or four years. And that would
imply, Elon, that before the end of President Trump's term in office, that AI would be moving
pretty damn quickly into the physical world, into the world of photons and atoms. And I'm thinking,
given your work with the administration, how confident are you that the U.S. will have the
manufacturing and the supply base to make good on your excitement about physical AI by the
end of -- by latter of this decade? We've seen pretty vulnerable right now. I've seen you tweeting
about -- or sorry, X-ing, excuse me, Elon about China, Freudian slip, about China having quite --
making more drones in a day than the U.S. makes in a year, and all the entanglement of the
supply. So what has to happen in the U.S. to make that possible? What's your message, and what
can you do about it, and what's relevant for Tesla shareholders? Thanks, Elon.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Well, at Tesla, obviously, we think manufacturing is cool. At SpaceX, we think manufacturing is
cool. But in general, for talented Americans, they need to beyond my companies, beyond me
and my teams here. In general, we need to make manufacturing cool again in America. And like, I
honestly think people should move from, like, law and finance into manufacturing. That's my
honest opinion. This is both a compliment and a criticism. We have too much talent in law and
finance in America, and there should be more of that talent in manufacturing. So yes. I mean, at
Tesla, we're making sure that we can continue to manufacture our stuff, even in the event of
geopolitical tensions rising to very high levels.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much. The next question will come from `Pierre Ferragu, New Street Research at New Street.
Pierre, please feel free to unmute yourself.
Q - `Pierre Ferragu, New Street Research `
Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. So I have a question, Elon, on deploying, like, robotaxis
in June in Austin. So that's great news. And I was wondering if it means I can drive down to Austin
in June and try unsupervised by myself with my car, or it's going to be more like your fleet testing
it?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
It'll be our fleet testing it. So that's our sort of toe in the water. We'll be scrutinizing it very
carefully to make sure it's not something we missed. But it will be autonomous ride-hailing for
money in Austin in June. And then, as swiftly as possible, other cities in America. And I expect us
to be operating -- doing unsupervised activity with our internal fleet in several cities by the end of
the year.
Then, it's probably next year when people are able to add or subtract their car from the fleet. So
kind of like Airbnb, where you can sort of add or subtract your house or your guest room. You can
say, like, add it to the Airbnb inventory or don't add it to the Airbnb inventory. If you're traveling
for a month, you can -- or whatever the case may be, you can let other people use your house.
And then you can.Anyway, so that's probably next year because we want to just make sure we've ironed out any
kinks. And a lot of it is not like, we're not splitting the atom here, it's just a bunch of work that
needs to be done to make sure the whole thing works efficiently, that people can order the car, it
comes to the right spot, does exactly the right thing, all the payment systems work, the billing
works. Yes.
Q - `Pierre Ferragu, New Street Research `
Okay. But then, like, so my follow-up question would be I have a Tesla, I have FSD, and I have to
keep my eyes on the road all the time. It's super boring, because I don't really need to intervene
anymore. But the really annoying thing is that I can't just check my emails. And so, are you working
or so on introducing like a kind of like free unsupervised where I could be eyes off and I would be
able to check my email and we just need to with a five second notice have to go back and keep
an eye on what's happening. Is that something you're working on as well, because it feels so
close with this setting that I don't know if it's something you'd expect for this year. It's very selfish
question. I ask for myself to be honest.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. We just need to -- we need to be very confident that the probability of injury is low before
we allow people to check with their email and text messages. In fact, right now, we're in this
perverse situation which you may have encountered yourself where people actually go to manual
driving to check their text messages so the computer doesn't yell at them, and then put it back
on autonomous mode once they've checked the text messages which is obviously less safe.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
Significantly less safe.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Significantly less safe. Significantly less safe than just letting people check their text once in a
while without the computer yelling at them. But we just want to be cautious about that at the
advent of that. We're in this sort of neither here nor there. But just for -- I mean I think it's not for
many months longer. But yes, we're in this perverse situation where people will turn the car off
autopilot so the computer doesn't yell at them, check the text messages while steering the car
with their knee and not looking out the window.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
Like Elon said, right, if you have any problems with the system and when people are not looking,
that is a dangerous thing. And that's what we're trying to avoid. It's -- the capability is getting
there but it's not fully there. That's why he was using the term of dipping our toe in the water,
then getting comfortable.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. Anyway, it's not far off. But we want to prove to ourselves and also prove to regulators that
the car is unequivocally safer in autonomous mode than not. And that's we're not far off. So this is
like low single-digit months.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `To the safety aspect, we did publish our safety -- vehicle safety report today and Q4 was one
crash for every 5.9 million miles driven compared to a crash every 700,000 miles without
autopilot.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Right. So we're getting to the point where it's an order of magnitude.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
Yes. It's like 8.5x. That's what's just about that.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. It's amazing.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. All righty. And our last question will be coming from `Dan Levy, Barclays at Barclays. Dan, feel free to
unmute yourself.
Q - `Dan Levy, Barclays `
Great. Good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. Elon, you talked about the need for
proliferation of sustainable transport in the past as part of a broader push to sustainable energy.
Look, I know we've heard a lot about President Trump's plans to reverse the EV mandate. And I
think there's a view that given regulation is a driver of EV uptake, this could slow EV uptake in the
U.S. So what would be your view on the right policy in the U.S. given your comments in the past of
the need to push for sustainable transport?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
At this point, I think that sustainable transport is inevitable. I'm highly confident that all transport
will be autonomous electric, including aircraft, and that it simply -- it's -- it can't be stopped any
more than one could have stopped the advent of the external combustion engine, steam engine,
or one could have stopped the advent of the internal combustion engine. Like even if you've
been the biggest force advocate on earth, like a forces of the way, not these newfangled car
automobiles, you can't stop the advent of the automobile. It's going to happen. And you can't
stop the advent of electric cars. It's going to happen. The only thing holding back electric cars was
range, and that is a solved problem.
Q - `Dan Levy, Barclays `
Great. And then as a follow-up. In the past, Elon, you had made a comment that you'd be willing
to sell cars effectively no margin to get the cars out there. And there's a comment in the release
today of the rate of acceleration of autonomy efforts does impact volume growth. So perhaps
you could just talk about with your efforts on FSD, how we should think about your desire to put
more vehicles out in the market to take advantage of your tech advances?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
So I'm not sure I understand the question, but we have a lot of cars. We've got millions of cars out
there.A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
So is your question, Dan, that how do we marry our future growth aspects with FSD?
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Go ahead and unmute yourself, Dan.
Q - `Dan Levy, Barclays `
Yes, more so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to sell your cars versus in
light of your improvements on FSD.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Well, right now, the constraint we're trying to solve is battery production as opposed to demand.
So we're -- and we're -- now, Q1 we've got this massive factory retooling for the new Model Y for
example, that obviously has a short-term impact on output. But the problem we're wrestling with,
in fact, we're talking -- the Executive Team and I were talking about just before this call was how --
we've got to figure out how to increase total gigawatt hours of battery production this year one
way or another. That's the constraint on our output.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. All righty. And with that, I think, we are all done for today. So thanks everyone so much for
all of your questions. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much and
goodbye.
