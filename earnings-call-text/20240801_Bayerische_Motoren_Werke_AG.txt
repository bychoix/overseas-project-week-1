Presentation
Unidentified Speaker
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Telephone Conference of the BMW
Group for the Second Quarter.
Today we have here as always `Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management, Chairman of the Board of Management; and our
CFO, `Walter Mertl, Finance. First, Oliver will give you a general business update for the BMW Group.
Walter will then take you through our financial recites. After a short break, we will then have time
for our Q&A sessions. So, we can start, Oliver, please go ahead.
`Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management `
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
In the past few days, several automotive manufacturers have released their half-year results. A
glance at the numbers shows just how differentiated our industry is. The basic principles are the
same for everyone, which reveals even more clearly how different strategic approaches are
performing in the current environment. All those, who are broadly diversified are reaping the
benefits.
Our own ambitions are underlined by the first six months. In the phase of headwinds, we can
capitalize on our competitive strength in the market. In the first half of 2024, BMW Group
deliveries were at the same high level as the previous year. Our core BMW brand is growing.
In terms of financial performance, we also deliver consistently high profitability. For the past 10
consecutive quarters, our EBIT margin in the automotive segment has been within our strategic
target range of 8% to 10% or higher. At 10.9%, the Group EBT margin once again outperformed
our strategic target of 10%. Above all, our all-electric vehicles and models in the higher-priced
upper segments of our BMW and BMW M brands remain in very high demand.
In our view, e-mobility will continue to be the core drive technology for the future and our primary
growth driver. We anticipated this development early, which is why we have one of the most
comprehensive and attractive EV portfolios in the marketplace today. We already offer at least
one BEV model in nearly every segment that is relevant for us. This wide-ranging offering lays the
foundation for our continued dynamic growth in BEVs, even in the current, more challenging
market environment.
In absolute terms, BMW comes in a strong third in electric vehicle sales among all OEMs
worldwide. Our impressive performance in ramping up electric mobility becomes even clearerwhen we look at the rate of growth in the first half of the year. With growth of 34%, the BMW
brand is number one worldwide among all relevant major players.
Take the example of the BMW X1, a customer favorite in our luxury sedan, the new BMW 7 Series.
In the case of both vehicles, one in five customers is already opting for the all-electric iX1 or i7
variant. And the 7 Series was a platinum award winner in the recent JD Power APEAL Study.
In the first half of 2024, our fully electric Sports Coupe, the BMW i4, remained our lineup's best-
selling electric vehicle, once again posting double-digit growth. I have emphasized many times
that following the hype without careful consideration is not a strategy. Emotionality and
nervousness has never been good counselors. Our strategy is grounded in facts, experience, and
a continuous realistic assessment of the current situation. It has proven robust, especially in
turbulent times. The approach to drive technology is rooted in this strategy, makes us resilient,
and secures our market success. We're a globally aligned, highly flexible production network.
We're capable of responding to fluctuations in demand better than others.
Supply chain management is increasingly critical to success. We have established processes to
identify risks in our supplier network at a very early stage. This enables us to take action and build
up stock before a risk becomes an issue. We have not had any major impact recently. This also
ensures that we can respond to regional differences in customer preferences as needed,
whether for cars with internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, or BEVs. And as a result, we've
consistently outperformed EU CO2 requirements for the past years. One thing is clear, the most
impactful contributions to climate protection are those we can make today. In other words, every
ton of CO2 we can save today, not some time in the future counts.
This also entails demanding and promoting the use of low CO2 fuels like e-fuels, E25 or HVO100
as quickly and as widely as possible. These fuels could immediately improve the carbon footprint
of the existing fleet of more than 250 million vehicles in the European Union. At the moment,
however, we see a significant risk of E-fuels being politically instrumentalized in the debate about
the ban on combustion ended from 2035. There are currently many indications that the EU
commission is striving for a bogus solution in which the ban on combustion engine is relaxed
simply by ostensibly opening up to e-fuels; however, if it then does nothing to accelerate the
ramp up of low CO2 fuels and make their use practicable, this would be a deliberate ban on
combustion engines through the back door.
We continue to believe that a categorical ban on combustion technology in 2035 is the wrong
approach. And we are also committed to our highly efficient engines and plug-in hybrid
technology such as used in our new BMW X3, and of course, as well as electromobility. As a
hybrid version, the high volume X3 enables locally emission-free premium mobility well beyond
city traffic. The new X3 will be released onto the market in the fourth quarter, initially in the United
States and Europe. And you all know how popular our X models are. Last year, the current X3 was
the bestselling model across our entire BMW product range. When the all-electric NEUE KLASSE
ramps up at our specially built plant in Debrecen in late 2025, it will initially launch with an X
model. This will be followed soon afterwards by a sporty sedan from Plant Munich.
With the NEUE KLASSE, our aim is to once again expand our technology leadership. Preparations
are in full swing and progressing according to plan despite the challenging conditions. Our
technology clusters allow us to quickly deploy the technologies of the NEUE KLASSE across our
entire vehicle portfolio, elevating it to a whole new level, regardless of the drive technology. And
mastering this degree of integration and executing it efficiently are highly complex tasks. This is
precisely where future competitiveness will be decided in our industry. It is why we continue tofocus on optimizing interaction between all technologies, creating a holistic mobility experience
for all our customers.
Our automated driving functions provide a good example of our technological edge. A few
weeks ago, we released a world first onto the market. We're the first automotive manufacturer to
offer the combination of a level 2 and level 3 driver assistance systems exclusively in Germany in
the new 7 series.
We've already obtained level 2 plus approval for numerous models of BMW in the United States,
Canada, and Germany, such as for the 5 series, the 7 series, the X5, the X6, the X7, the XM, and
the iX, making this another field, where our technology clearly sets us apart. We will solidify this
leading position with the NEUE KLASSE.
Ladies and gentlemen, the automotive industry is a major driver of the global economy, which
increasingly makes it the focus of geopolitical interests. The issues range from growing regulation
to protectionist measures in the major economic areas of the United States, China, and the
European Union. We are seeing global competition for raw materials and access to strategically
critical technologies such as high voltage batteries and semiconductors, as well as advancements
in AI applications. Each region and individual state is seeking to protect its own economic
interests. This also includes localizing the entire automotive value chain, including supply chains.
At the global BMW group, we remain committed to local engagement and to open markets and
opposed to artificial barriers such as punitive tariffs. The introduction of additional import duties,
like those recently imposed by the EU, leads us down a dead end street and will ultimately not
make European manufacturers any more competitive. On the contrary, EU tariffs on BEV from
China instead penalize European manufacturers like the BMW Group, since they also produce
vehicles in China for the European market. Additional customs duties also limit the choice of
electric cars for European customers and could therefore slow down decarbonization in the
transport sector. Measures always lead to countermeasures. Let us not forget that
implementation of the Green Deal in Europe also relies heavily on raw materials and technology
from China in particular.
Ladies and gentlemen, with our long-term yet flexible strategy, we are in the driver's seat. We
adapt quickly, swiftly, and effectively as conditions evolve. We see no reason for hasty action or
fundamental course adjustments. We will continue on our path in the future. That means,
sometimes we do things differently, but always out of conviction, not merely on principle. This is
what makes BMW strong and successful in the long-term. The fact of the matter is the
automotive industry will remain a growth sector in the future. And we intend to make sure the
BMW Group in particular benefits from it. Thank you.
Unidentified Speaker
Thank you very much, Oliver. And now over to our CFO, `Walter Mertl, Finance.
`Walter Mertl, Finance `
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
The BMW Group remains on track and confirms its targets for 2024, despite the volatile market
environment. After a successful start to the year, we again achieved a EBIT margin for the
automotive segment within our full year target range of 8% to 10% in the second quarter, thanks
to our attractive product portfolio. At the same time, we are continuing to invest in our future
model lineup and securing the company's long-term competitiveness.As of June, BMW Group global sales remained on par with last year. The BMW brand grew by
2.3% globally, or 6.2% if we exclude the Chinese market. Global growth drivers are our all-electric
vehicles and models from the upper premium segment, both of which saw a double-digit
increase. The Group EBT margin came in at 10.5% for the second quarter and 10.9% for the first
half year. The automotive EBIT margin reached 8.4% in the second quarter and 8.6% for the half
year, both within our full year target range of 8% to 10%. Excluding the depreciation resulting from
the purchase price allocation of BVA, the margins came in at 9.4% for the second quarter and
9.6% through six-month.
Ladies and gentlemen, the BMW Group is committed to maintaining its strategic focus. We have a
clear plan and a long-term strategy that we are implementing systematically. At the same time,
we remain highly flexible in our execution and are able to respond swiftly to market
developments. This enables our operating business to deliver consistently good results.
Let's take a look at the financial figures in the second quarter in more detail, starting with a brief
overview of the group. BMW Group revenues were on par with the previous year. Group earnings
before tax totaled around EUR3.9 billion, resulting in a group EBT margin of 10.5%.
On the next slide, you can see how the automotive segment performed across key figures. In the
second quarter, the BMW Group delivered approximately 619,000 BMW MINI and Rolls-Royce
vehicles to customers. The BMW brand reported sales growth of 2.2%. MINI, on the other hand,
saw a significant decrease from the previous year due to the planned model changeover across
the entire product range; however, in the second half of the year, the brand will benefit from the
ramp-up of the new MINI family with the Countryman and Cooper, both available in several
drivetrains, as well as the all-electric Aceman.
We continue to see sales growth of our all-electric vehicles. The BMW Group delivered about
108,000 BEVs to customers in the second quarter. This represents 17.4% of our total sales. Our
electrified vehicles, in other words, BEVs plus plug-in hybrids, accounted for almost 24% of total
sales in the second quarter. Segment revenues increased slightly by 1.4%. Adjusted for currency
translation effects, revenues saw an increase of 2.1%.
The significant growth in all-electric vehicles and models from the upper premium segment
contributed to this. The current trend is also expected to have a positive effect on revenues for
the remainder of 2024. Revenue per wholesale unit across the entire product portfolio is
expected to be in line with last year's level. EBIT for the period from April to June totaled EUR2.7
billion. The EBIT margin came in at 8.4% for the quarter and 8.6% for the half-year. Excluding the
depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BVA, the EBIT margin was 9.4% for
the second quarter and 9.6% for the six-month. That brings me to the EBIT bridge to explain in
more detail the changes in the operating result compared to the second quarter of the previous
year.
The net balance of currency and commodity positions provided a tailwind of EUR500 million over
last year's second quarter. For the full year 2024, we anticipate a positive net balance from
currency and commodity positions. This is expected to nearly offset material cost headwinds.
However, we see additional requests for supply chain support. The net balance of volume, model
mix, and pricing effects in the second quarter was about EUR300 million lower year-on-year.
Volume development and the model mix made a positive contribution to this. The global price
environment for new and used cars continued to normalize in the second quarter. The Chinese
market in particular remains highly competitive. For the full year 2024, we expect the net effect
from volumes, model mix, and prices to be neutral over last year.Research and development expenses increased by about EUR100 million compared to the prior-
year quarter. The BMW Group's research and development expenditure remained at a high level
through the end of June, totaling almost EUR4.2 billion. The R&D ratio according to the German
Commercial Code was at 5.7% after the first six months. The capitalization ratio for development
costs, which is relevant for R&D costs according to IFRS, was 34% in the second quarter and
30.8% as of June.
Selling and administrative expenses increased by around EUR100 million compared to the
previous year, primarily driven by personal costs and expenses for IT projects. A headwind of
EUR200 million from other cost changes can mainly be attributed to the manufacturing costs.
Here inflation in material costs continues to have an impact.
Free cash flow in the automotive segment totaled EUR1 billion in the second quarter. The change
in working capital amounting to EUR500 million is largely due to the planned increase in inventory
levels. This ensures we can continue to meet global demand for our products in the second half
of this year. The net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by
EUR400 million in the second quarter. Total investments for April to June amounted to around
EUR2.6 billion.
The CapEx ratio came in at 5.8% for the second quarter and 4.7% for the half year. As in the
previous years, the major share of capital expenditure will occur in the second half of the year
and especially in the fourth quarter. We expect a CapEx ratio of more than 6% for the full year.
Changes to provisions positively impacted free cash flow in the second quarter by around
EUR100 million. The change in the position other of around EUR800 million mainly reflects regular
tax payments. After the first six months, automotive segment free cash flow had reached just
over EUR2.3 billion. The difference in free cash flow compared to 2023 is due to the CapEx
increase of around EUR1 billion. We expect to see a positive contribution from a reduction in
working capital by end of this year. For the full year, we are targeting a free cash flow of over
EUR6 billion.
Since 2022, we have made a paradigm shift in our shareholder return strategy by adding a share
buyback program that supplements our annual dividend payout. In doing so, we have increased
the payout ratio of automotive free cash flow by paying dividends in our target corridor of 30% to
40% as well as using the share buyback program.
BMW AG is continuing with a share repurchase program as planned. At the end of June, it had
acquired shares equivalent to 5.51% of the existing share capital as of June 30th. The second
tranche of the second program totaling EUR500 million was completed in June. The third tranche
of EUR500 million, which began in June will be concluded no later than December 31st. By the
end of 2024, BMW AG will have repurchased shares values at EUR1.5 billion as part of the second
program, which amounts to EUR2 billion in total.
Ladies and gentlemen, the BMW Group has a solid and robust balance sheet confirming the
company's considerable financial strength. This is also underscored by our net financial assets in
the automotive business, which total just over EUR43 billion. Starting with the half-year report
2024, we are changing the way we report net financial assets in our automotive business. In
addition to the automotive segments, NFA that was previously reported, the new figure also
includes the NFA of holding companies within the other entities segment, which receive regular
distributions from their subsidiaries. I trust that this new comprehensive definition of net financial
assets provides you with useful additional information.Let's move on to the financial services segment. Here the positive trend in new business
continues for financing of both new and used vehicles. A total of about 50,000 new leasing and
credit financing contracts were concluded in the first half year. This represents a significant
increase of 16.5% year-over-year. The volume of new business encompassing all new credit
financing and leasing contracts climbed 18.2% to around EUR32 billion. This positive development
in new business is also reflected in the portfolio. Total value of all contracts managed surpassed
EUR143 billion for the first time.
Segment earnings amounted to just under EUR1.5 billion. This year-on-year decrease of 13.1%
resulted mainly from lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles, which reflects the
continued normalization of the used car market. During the reporting period, the credit loss ratio
for the entire credit portfolio was 0.25%. In 2023, it was 0.15%. The segment's overall business
performance was better than anticipated; and for this reason, we are raising our full-year
guidance for return on equity from a range between 14% and 17% to a range between 15% and
18%.
In the motorcycle segment, second quarter deliveries increased by 2.6% compared to the
previous year's quarter. EBIT in the second quarter totaled EUR110 million with an EBIT margin of
11.1%.
Ladies and gentlemen, the BMW Group is on course to meet its targets for the year. The market
development in China in the first half year has not met our expectations, but we expect that the
various measures taken by the government, including the cut in and lending rates in July, will lead
to a stabilization of the market starting in the third quarter. Our overall business environment will
remain challenging throughout the rest of the year.
Our guidance assumes that geopolitical and microeconomic conditions will not deteriorate. Group
earnings before tax will decrease slightly. We expect to see a slight increase in demand with sales
in the automotive segment slightly higher than the previous year. Percentage of all electric
vehicles will increase significantly. We are targeting an EBIT margin between 8% and 10% and the
return on capital employed between 15% and 20%. Deliveries are projected to increase slightly in
the motorcycle segment. The EBIT margin should come in between 8% and 10% with a return on
capital employed between 21% and 26%.
In the financial services segment, we are now forecasting a return on equity in the range of in the
range of 15% to 18% for the full year.
Ladies and gentlemen, the BMW Group is pursuing a clear strategic approach focused on long-
term success. Our company maintains a globally balanced footprint. We are leveraging this
balance and the high flexibility of all our systems to mitigate market volatility and consistently
provide our customers with the best products to suit their needs. We continue to systematically
implement our electrification and digitalization strategy and make targeted investments in our
future model lineup.
In 2024, we are setting a decisive course for our future. Research and development spending
and capital expenditure will therefore respectively peak as planned. We expect our R&D ratio for
the full year to exceed 5% with a CapEx ratio of more than 6%. Despite these high upfront
investments, we were still able to deliver a solid financial performance in the second quarter
thanks to our attractive product range. Across global markets, we are carefully steering our
performance in line with individual market conditions. And at the same time, we are maintaining a
high level of cost discipline. Whether manufacturing costs, fixed costs, or capital expenditure, atthe BMW Group, we have always constantly optimized our cost structures and will continue to do
so.
I am confident that our clear long-term strategy combined with focused execution in our
operational business will keep us competitive and successful both now and in the future. Thank
you.

Hello. Thank you very much for taking my question. My question, I have two questions, but the
first is about MINI imports. How is your -- how is it going in your negotiation or talks with the EU in
terms of getting -- reducing the tariffs on the EV and the Aceman? Is that going to hurt your
targets if it turns out you cannot get those tariffs reduced or -- and why did Spotlight not originally
cooperate with the EU on this one? Thank you.
