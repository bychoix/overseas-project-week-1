Q1 2021 Earnings Call

Presentation
`Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to welcome you all to our telephone
conference for the first quarter results. With us today are, `Oliver Zipse, Chairman, Chairman of the Board of
Management; and `Nicolas Peter, CFO & Member of Management Board, our CFO. First, `Oliver Zipse, Chairman will give you an update on the
business performance during the quarter. `Nicolas Peter, CFO & Member of Management Board will then take you through our financial
results. Afterwards, we will have time for our Q&A session.
Now, Oliver, please go ahead.
`Oliver Zipse, Chairman `
Good afternoon, also from my side, ladies and gentlemen. The BMW Group is a global company.
We leveraged this strategic strength both during the financial year 2020 and of course, in the first
quarter of 2021. When the market situation is difficult in individual regions of the world, the other
markets carry us through.
Since the start of the pandemic, we have done everything possible to create a safe working
environment for our employees. And we also offer safe and contact-free delivery of vehicles to
customers. In more than 60 markets, we have set up mobile sales offices. And our new customer,
brands and sales system is taking advantage of the momentum and growing acceptance of
digital services that has been building over the past year. Our very strong results underline the
viability of our business model, even during one of the worst crisis the global economy has faced.
It is robust, in demand all over the world and full of innovations. In many areas, we have picked up
the pace once again.
I would like to give you a brief overview, focusing on three main points. First, we are on course for
growth and we are growing profitably. Second, we are growing sustainably and have a clear
roadmap into the future. Third, we are shaping the technology for tomorrow's mobility.
Let's now start with the first point. The BMW Group delivered excellent results in the first quarter
of 2021. Markets worldwide are recovering. Our diverse product portfolio is reaching large groupsof customers, and our ongoing efficiency measures are paying off. This shows clearly our strategy
is having a real impact.
The Automotive segment delivered an EBIT margin of 9.8% in the first quarter, back within our
strategic medium target range for the first time in 10 quarters. As in the past, the EBIT margin
does not include the at-equity results from our BBA joint venture in China. Another indicator of
our operating strength is our free cash flow of EUR2.5 billion in the Automotive Segment, our
best figure ever for a first quarter.
Our first quarter deliveries also reached a new all-time high, compared with the first quarter of
2019. In other words, the comparable period before the crisis, group sales increased by 6%. Our
total market share worldwide has climbed up to 3.3% from 2.9% in the same period 2019. Our
performance in the Chinese market stands out, in particular. Compared to the first quarter of
2019 again, pre-crisis, our China sales increased by more than 36%.
We recently presented our model line-up for our largest market at the Auto Show in Shanghai
2021. With highly innovative, digitalized, electric and, above all, exceptionally high-quality products
like the BMW iX3, the BMW iX and the BMW i4, we intend to sustain our growth in China. Our
electrified models are also in high demand globally.
In the first quarter, we were the biggest manufacturer of plug-in hybrids worldwide. With more
than 70,000 electrified vehicles sold in the first three months of 2021, we are on track to have a
total of one million fully-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids on the roads by the end of the year.
This also illustrates the success of our flexible architecture strategy. The BMW iX3 is receiving
consistently outstanding ratings from the automotive press, not only because of its many
impressive characteristics, such as its quality, comfort, connectivity, operating ease and dynamic
performance, but also its range. Its efficient drivetrain puts it on par with electric models with the
highest ranges among all brands within its segment.
Just yesterday, I met with journalists testing pre-production models of the BMW i4. This car will
put e-mobility right at the heart of the BMW brand. And therefore, I am extremely confident we
will be able to build on our e-mobility successes with the BMW i4 and BMW iX. Growth remains
our industry's strongest currency. Before the end of the decade, we want to reach the milestone
of 3 million delivered vehicles annually. As far as the BMW Group is concerned, we are also
growing profitably and sustainably. And we will make sure this continues.
That brings me to my second point. We are growing sustainably. Sustainability is the new
language that connects the world. The three major world markets; Europe, the US and China, as
well as other industrial nations, have set themselves ambitious goals on the road to climate
neutrality. They have recently confirmed and even stepped up these targets.
The next big binding step will be the year 2030, also for the BMW Group. And remind yourself,
this is only eight and a half years away. We have geared our company entirely towards
sustainability. By 2030, we aim to reduce our actual carbon footprint per vehicle by at least a third
from 2019 levels in a verifiable and transparent manner everywhere around the world.
During our Annual Conference, we published an Integrated BMW Group Report for the first time,
which documents our progress and most importantly, gives equal weighting to our sustainable
development and financial indicators. A company does not become sustainable simply by flipping
a switch or buying certificates. What counts is not alleged sustainability but verifiable measures
that deliver a real impact. That is why we joined the Science Based Targets Initiative.We think about sustainability in a way that goes far beyond emissions. Energy and resource
consumption will be the next, much, much bigger issue. Raw materials are becoming more
expensive. Water and many mineral resources are scarce and valuable commodities. And we are
seeing that especially right now, this is why it is so important to think in terms of a circular model
and reduce our use of materials from the outset.
To achieve this, we are relying on partnerships and collaboration across our industry, with NGOs
as well as political institutions. This requires hard work, investment and an ongoing commitment.
We firmly believe we will add value for society in this way, and also become a stronger company
in the long term at the same time.
Let me give you now a few examples from the last few months alone. We significantly
overfulfilled our CO2 fleet targets in Europe last year and we are strategically on course to meet
the goals for 2021 and far beyond. Both further development of our conventional drivetrains and
our electromobility offensive will play a big part in this.
Second example, with support from the strategic EU program, IPCEI, which stands for Important
Projects of Common European Interest, we are involved in another project that is advancing
battery technology. We are conducting research into a new generation of sustainable batteries,
optimized for use in a circular model for vehicle use, then for stationary energy storage and
finally, for efficient dismantling and reuse of materials.
Our suppliers rely on 100% green power to produce battery cells. And at the same time, we are
increasing our use of secondary material. To give you a concrete example, in the BMW iX, we are
reducing carbon emissions in the supply chain by 17% compared to the same vehicle produced
without these measures. Another example, we have signed multi-year supply contracts for
sustainable lithium from South America with the American company, Livent. Livent uses a special
method that minimizes the impact of lithium extraction on the surrounding ecosystem. And also
with immediate effect, we will be sourcing half the aluminium needed by our light metal foundry
in Landshut from Emirates Global Aluminium. The aluminium is produced using electricity from
one of the world's largest solar parks.
Another example is our investment in Boston Metal. We are also promoting green innovations in
steel production. Boston Metal is working on the industrialization of electrolysis processes in
production of liquid iron. We aim to reduce our CO2 emissions from steel by about 2 million
tonnes by 2030.
And additionally, we have launched an initiative to protect the deep seas with the WWF, Google,
Samsung SDI and the Volvo Group. We will not source minerals from deep-sea mining until there
has been a full scientific investigation into the impact. All these examples show that sustainability
cannot be taken for granted. It takes a lot of different measures to achieve a large-scale effect,
as well as a conscious openness towards choosing the most effective technology in each case.
Our ambition is clear. The greenest electric car will be a BMW. However, we also know that we
always have to and we will combine sustainability with technology, innovation and very inspiring
products for our customers. That is our BMW way. And we will continue full speed ahead.
That brings me to my third and final point. We are shaping the technology for tomorrow's
mobility. We are once again upping the pace of our electromobility offensive and plan to deliver
more than 100,000 fully-electric vehicles to customers this year. By 2023, we will have at least
one fully-electric model on the roads in all key segments from the compact segment to the ultra-
luxury class.By 2030, at least half of our global sales will come from fully-electric vehicles. In Europe maybe a
little bit more. We are electrifying all our brands to achieve this. MINI will release its final model
with a combustion-engine variant in 2025. At Rolls-Royce, electric driving will soon define a new
form of luxury. And at BMW, we are ready for a strong market ramp-up for the i4, the iX, the 7
series, the X1, the 5 series and other models.
We will also be introducing our new and self-developed BMW Operating System 8 with the BMW
iX, a new generation of performance, user experience and intelligent driver assistance. And in
combination with high-performance hardware, we are capable of processing more data live than
ever before. The data transfer is 10 times to 20 times faster than in previous systems. We have
also enhanced our award-winning and safe display and operating concept.
BMW's Operating System 8 is designed for 5G connectivity, with complete functionality for
applications like our powerful cloud-based navigation system, BMW Maps. Third-party services
can be fully integrated into the operating system. This applies, for instance, to services from
Apple, Google, Tencent or Spotify, which can transform the vehicle into the perfect digital
companion. And we already introduced over-the-air updates for our vehicles with BMW Operating
System 7 in 2018 already. More than one million vehicles have already received over-the-air
upgrades. This was a huge success that we will continue to build on. In many cases, our vehicles
can be configured with functions on demand at a later date.
By the end of this year, we will have the largest connected fleet in the world, with around two and
a half million vehicles with Remote Software Upgrade capabilities. And we are already planning
the next big step. At the Annual Conference, we unveiled the broad strokes of our vehicle
strategy from the middle of this decade, the Neue Klasse electric, digital and circular. It will be key
to the future success of the BMW Group. We are putting all our know-how and our considerable
investment into this development.
The Neue Klasse will establish a new generation of technology modules, targeting maximum
synergies and scalability for our entire vehicle portfolio. We will be introducing a new digital
architecture and a new generation of electrical system. We will also be taking the next leap with
our electric powertrain and leveraging the opportunities of the new architecture to redesign our
batteries.
At our Battery Cell Competence Center, we are currently testing different cell chemistries,
formats and modules. We aim to realize an automotive-compatible solid-state battery in
collaboration with the battery specialist Solid Power by the end of the decade. We will present an
initial demonstrator vehicle with these batteries well before 2025.
Ladies and Gentlemen, The BMW Group is on course for success. We are growing and reaching
more customers than ever. We are focused on our goal of reaching three million units sold in a
single financial year within this decade. And in recent years, we have been working hard to get
back on a profitable track.
Today, we are seeing the benefits of this strategy. We are setting the standard with our
sustainable global business model. We will eliminate mobility as a climate factor in the long term
by implementing impactful and transparent measures in the BMW style. And we are paving the
way for the next leaps in technology that will inspire our customers even 10 years from now.
Thank you very much for your attention.
`Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental AffairsThank you very much. Oliver. Nicolas, please go ahead.
`Nicolas Peter, CFO & Member of Management Board `
Thanks, Max.
Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. The BMW Group made a good start to the financial year
2021. Our operating result in the first quarter was at a very high level and we exceeded market
expectations. We achieved all of this despite growing headwinds from rising raw material prices
and in a market environment that remains volatile due to the coronavirus pandemic.
We were also able to maintain the supply of semiconductors in the first quarter. As a result, there
were no interruptions in production during the reporting period. However, the situation remains
difficult. Significantly improved pricing was a key driver for our strong group earnings. Additionally,
the positive trend of the second half year in 2020 continued during the first quarter in all major
regions of the world with over 636,000 vehicles delivered.
In particular, our electrified vehicle fleet once again proved to be an engine for growth. Our sales
of electrified vehicles more than doubled from the same period of last year to over 70,000 units.
This means more than one in 10 vehicles we sell is already electrified. This underlines the high
and steadily growing importance of electromobility to our company.
We took advantage of the past year to make ourselves more efficient and more profitable for
the long term. In addition to the better pricing I mentioned before, this includes strict
management of fixed costs, a focus on controlling our inventory levels and cost-efficient
personnel structures. The company-wide performance program continues to deliver important
contributions to sustainable earnings growth. Ladies and Gentlemen, all these factors are having
a positive impact on our financial figures.
Let's now take a closer look at our financial performance. Group revenues for the first quarter of
2021 totaled around EUR26.8 billion. Group earnings before tax reached EUR3.76 billion and were
therefore significantly higher than the previous year. The EBT margin stood at 14%. The
development in pre-owned car markets also contributed to the margin increase through higher
prices for the sale of end-of-lease vehicles.
Manufacturing costs rose compared to the previous year, mainly driven by the overall increase in
sales volume and the growing share of electrified vehicles. But also rising raw material prices
contributed to the increase. These increases, however, were partially offset by lower risk
provisioning. These results show that we are on track with our transformation process.
Today's profitability will secure our future competitiveness. We continue to make systematic
investments in important future areas of activity, such as digitalization and electrification. This year
alone, two all-electric vehicles will be released onto the market; the BMW i4 and the BMW iX,
important milestones in our electromobility offensive.
Research and development expenditure was almost on a par with last year at around EUR1.3
billion. Our R&D ratio of 4.8% was lower than in 2020, due to the company's high revenues. The
ratio of capitalized development costs of 22.6% was also lower year-on-year. The financial result
of EUR732 million for the first quarter climbed more than EUR1.3 billion from the same period of
last year.
One the one hand, this was mainly due to significantly higher earnings of EUR503 million from
BMW Brilliance Automotive, which had been heavily impacted in the previous year by China'ssignificantly year-on-year to reach a total of EUR334 million. This was due in particular to positive
valuation effects compared to the previous year.
Group liquidity increased EUR20.1 billion in the first quarter, reflecting the strong operating result
and positive free cash flow. Over the coming months, we will bring liquidity back within our target
range of EUR17 billion to EUR18 billion.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's move on to the segments, beginning with the Automotive segment.
The segment's EBIT margin for the first quarter was 9.8% and underlines the company's excellent
performance. The key drivers here were the improved pricing, the significant increase in sales
and higher aftersales revenues. Significant growth was posted by all three BMW Group brands;
BMW MINI and Rolls Royce. Rolls-Royce had its best quarter ever, selling a total of 1,380
automobiles. At BMW, in addition to the electrified vehicles, the BMW X models were especially in
demand, as well as the BMW 3 series and BMW 5 series. The high earnings quality is also
reflected in our strong free cash flow of EUR2.52 billion. A key driver, in addition to the significant
increase in earnings before tax was a strict management of our working capital. The segment's
net financial assets rose significantly year-on-year to EUR21.3 billion due to the strong free cash
flow.
Let's turn now to the Financial Services segment. This segment also got off to a good start this
year, with around 489,000 new financing and leasing contracts concluded with retail customers
during the reporting period. This represents a solid increase of 8.8% over the previous year. The
recovery in new business with retail customers can be attributed to significant growth in financing
business.
Segment earnings before tax increased significantly to EUR787 million. The improved result was
mostly due to the positive development of the pre-owned vehicle markets, and the related
improvement in the risk situation for the segment. In the prior year quarter, additional risk
provisioning for anticipated credit and residual value risks was needed due to the uncertainty
created by the pandemic.
Credit losses remain at a low level. The Financial Services segment makes comprehensive
provisions for its main business risks on an ongoing basis. Current assessments confirm that
residual value and credit risks are appropriately covered.
The Motorcycles segment successfully continued its growth strategy in the first quarter. Over the
past year, 13 new models were released onto the market. During the reporting period, more than
42,500 motorcycles were delivered to customers. This is significantly more than in the same
period of last year. The EBIT margin in this segment was 17.9%.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's take a look at our guidance for the year. We made a strong start to
2021. Despite this, we expect to see increasing volatility and we will continuously reassess the risk
situation. The semiconductor supply situation will remain difficult, for instance. Additional
headwinds are also expected due to the rising raw material prices, particularly for rhodium,
palladium and steel. The volatile corona situation continues to affect the BMW Group's business
performance.
Based on current information, we are able to confirm our guidance for 2021. The following
forecast for the main key figures does not take into account possible effects in connection with
the European Commission's ongoing antitrust proceedings. We expect to see a significant
increase in group pre-tax earnings this year. The Automotive segment should post a solid
increase in the number of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles delivered to customers comparedWe expect the EBIT margin in the Automotive segment to be at the higher end of our target
range of 6% to 8%, with a significant increase in ROCE for the automotive business. Our share of
electrified vehicles in our deliveries will also continue to increase over the course of the year.
In the Financial Services segment, we expect return on equity to be at the higher end of our
target range of 12% to 15%. In the Motorcycles segment, we anticipate a solid increase in
deliveries. EBIT margin should be within our target range of 8% to 10%, and ROCE for the
segment should also be significantly higher year-on-year.
Now, let's take a look at the non-financial indicators. Thanks to ongoing personnel restructuring
measures, it should be possible to achieve the above-mentioned goals with a slightly smaller
workforce size than the previous year. The percentage of female managers at the BMW Group
will increase slightly as planned. We will significantly reduce CO2 emissions in our new vehicle
fleet once again. According to the planning, CO2 emissions per vehicle produced are likely to fall
moderately.
Ladies and Gentlemen, our thinking and actions are always geared towards the long term. We are
setting the right course today to achieve our short, medium and long-term goals. This applies, in
particular, to our focus areas of digitalization, electrification and sustainability. Our products are in
demand and our operating business is performing well.
For the remainder of the year, we expect a free cash flow of over EUR4 billion. We have the right
strategy to successfully continue our transformation process based on our high profitability.
Although we expect the second half of the year to be more volatile, we are optimistic about the
future.
Thank you for your attention.
`Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Thank you very much, Nicolas. So let's move to our Q&A session. The line will shortly be open for
questions. Please wait for some technical advice.
Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And the first question is from `Stephen Reitman, Analyst, Societe Generale, Societe Generale. Your
line is now open.
Q - `Stephen Reitman, Analyst, Societe Generale `
Thank you very much. I had two questions. First question is about semiconductors. I can fully
understand that BMW has shown in the past that it's very forward thinking. It's very aware of
market conditions. And so probably it was one of the first companies to see that the markets
were recovering faster than maybe others had anticipated. And so you made sure you had your
orders for semiconductors in early. So, you're getting a good supply on that. But how do you
cope with the sort of acts of God, like, for example, the Texas freeze and the fire in Renesas,
which clearly just meant that some of the suppliers were not physically able to supply.
My second question is about China and the iX3 and globally as well. Looking at the sales of the
iX3 so far in China, it looks like it's done about 8,000 units of a third [ph] at wholesale. Could you
comment on the ramp-up of that vehicle, what your plans are? And where do you think it mightdo one of global scale as well? I understand the car is not going to be sold in the United States.
But what are the orders like, what indications for Europe, please?
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Thank you very much, Stephen. Your question will be answered by our CEO, Oliver, please.
A - `Oliver Zipse, Chairman `
Yes, Stephen, very important question. The semiconductor, as you rightfully noted, there is only
one incidents where our supply chains are challenged. Yeah. You mentioned the Renesas fire in
Japan. You mentioned the Texas winter incident. And we are completely aware of this. Why do
we comparably well-managed these things? BMW is a producer of individual vehicles. And it's
kind of a normal day-to-day business to have a very precise supply chain management.
Otherwise, you could not build each individual vehicle different than the one before. So, we kind
of trained this specific muscle of supply chain management. And of course, in terms of crisis, you
can play out the strength of this trained muscle.
On the other hand, to have disruptions in the supply chain is kind of a normality in our industry. Of
course, this is now very publicly commentated and so on. And it is a challenge. That's why we --
last week, we already idled two plants, Oxford and Nedcar in the Netherlands. And in the second
quarter, you will see more of this idling, but not in a magnitude where it will endanger our
business overall. And our assumption today is in quarter two, we will adherence there. There is
some challenges on the production scheduling side. But everything we lose in quarter two, we will
be able to compensate in the second half of the year. So the overall effect will not be, at least
from today's point of view, very big. But there is disruption. And therefore, we are careful.
Because this is today's view on -- in May. And there is still two-thirds of the year ahead of us. So,
we will have to see. Until now, we are -- I think we have managed it very well.
The iX3, that was your second question, Stephen, it's ramping up worldwide right into our plans.
And in effect, we just increased our production plans. So, we are quite happy with the iX3,
specifically, as I mentioned in my short speech, wherever we go into automotive testing and
comparable -- comparing the vehicles, the iX3 is turning out to be an extremely good vehicle in
many aspects. And therefore, market demand is high. But we didn't bring it to the United States
because I think a specific car has to fit to specific markets. And I think the demand in China and
Europe is so high that we will concentrate on the iX and the i4 in the United States.
Q - `Stephen Reitman, Analyst, Societe Generale `
Thank you.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Thank you very much, Stephen. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question is from `Kai Mueller, Analyst, Barclays, Barclays. Your line is now open.
Q - `Kai Mueller, Analyst, Barclays `
Thank you very much for taking my question. The first one is really around your guidance. You
indicated that you're at the upper end of your range. Now the 6% to 8% on the automotive side.
But you're still indicating this free cash flow guide above EUR4 billion. Can you give us a bit ofcolor? Is there more room to be really above the EUR4 billion maybe towards the EUR5 billion
mark, given near the upper end? Or what are really the moving parts when we think about free
cash flow, in particular, after we've seen the strong EUR2.5 billion in Q1?
And then the second point is you mentioned China will continue to stay strong. Is the current
sales level that we've seen, something we should be able to extrapolate forward for the rest of
the year and into next year? And could you give us a bit of color as well? I understand you have a
big ramp-up in terms of M models as well. How does that fit in with your China strategy and also
with your emission targets here in Europe?
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Thank you very much, Kai. We start with your China question. And Oliver, and then Nicola. Oliver,
please?
A - `Oliver Zipse, Chairman `
Yeah, Kai. Thank you for this China question, which, of course, was expected because China is, of
course, is a booming nation and by the way, you -- the United States are picking up rapidly with
that pace as well. We believe that this positive momentum we see in China will stay this year, of
course, but also next year not only because of the cyclical development, but our customer base is
increasing. The middle class normally buys our vehicles is becoming stronger and stronger and
we have a really strong brand position in China. And that is propelling our development there.
And of course, the regulation towards electrical vehicles plays right into our hands because these
cars are here or will soon be here and therefore, we are quite confident about China, but not
only China, we are also optimistic about Asia overall, Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia developing
really well. So, we are optimistic also about the whole Pacific region there. And regarding the mix,
we have there M models. We are a supplier of all segments. We have in the lower segments, the
MINI. We have in the upper segment, Rolls-Royce. We have high-performance cars like the M
models. And relatively to today's world, they are also -- they are -- all of them are becoming
better and better every day in terms of their emission levels. And it's part of our business model,
and we are improving by day and day. And also M models, they are here to stay.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Nicolas?
A - `Nicolas Peter, CFO & Member of Management Board `
Kai, first of all, you're absolutely right. Our Q1 free cash flow was very strong with -- at EUR2.5
billion. Now if we look at the positive and the negative elements we expect in the coming
months, on the positive side, clearly, the development of our business ex BBA. Of course, we will
have a China dividend in Q2 or in Q3 in our free cash flow, and we will continue to manage in a
very, very focused manner, our working capital. So, those are the positives. On the other hand
side, we definitely will see some outflow from provisions, some more outflow on the investment
side and taxes are normalizing. So, we will have more tax payments due to the development of
our result, in particular, in the second half of the year. Having said this, I'm very confident that we
will be above EUR4 billion.
Q - `Kai Mueller, Analyst, Barclays `
Thank you very much. Very clear. Thank you.A - `Oliver Zipse, Chairman `
Very clear, yes. And this, from our CFO.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Good. Thank you very much, Kai. Next question, please.
Operator
The next question is from `Patrick Hummel, Analyst, UBS, UBS. Your line is now open.
Q - `Patrick Hummel, Analyst, UBS `
Thank you very much. Patrick from UBS here. Two questions. The first one, really a big picture one.
And I'm not even sure if it's a CEO or a CFO question. Are you focusing on growth or cash
return? What I mean with that is if I look around in the global OEM landscape, there are now
companies that are really saying, okay, this is the time to invest. We want to win in the mobility
business models of the future, software, autonomous, et cetera. And they're cutting the
dividends and stopping share buyback programs, et cetera.
On the other hand, you have players that are very much focused on generating cash flow. And it
feels to me, BMW is a little bit in the middle there. You're talking about profitable growth. You
have accumulated EUR21 billion of net interest-bearing assets and your dividend policy is in light
of the cash flow you're generating, certainly not the maximum of what you could do. So, I'm just
wondering, where do you sit? Do you sit in the growth camp or in the cash return camp?
And my second question comes back to the guidance. As far as the margin is concerned, I hear
you loud and clear, you're guiding to the upper end of that EBIT margin target range. But you're
warning about commodity headwinds in the second half. I'm just wondering, your pricing power is
so strong right now, industry-wide and BMW specifically. Why should these commodities actually
be a headwind at all? Can't you just pass that on to the consumers? And as a consequence, with
H2 demand looking very strong as well and volumes may be even better because the chip
shortage industry-wide should be easing, why wouldn't H2 margins be even better?
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Good. Thank you very much, Patrick. We start with our CEO, Oliver. Yes.
A - `Oliver Zipse, Chairman `
Patrick, there's a very simple answer. We are in both camps. We're in the growth camp and the
cash return camp. Why is that? The year 2021 forthcoming are not a surprise for us. We always
knew there will be a lot of technologies available in our product portfolio to grow this growth
profitably. And as Nicolas said before, we don't grow without being profitable. These times are
completely over. But when you look at the world currently, we serve in more than 150 markets.
And in every country, the technology with which you grow profitably is a different one.
Let me give you a brief example. Germany in the first three months of the year, we had 40% on
the petrol side, 35%, one-third on the diesel side and with a big growing proportion, 25% on the
electromobility side. So very -- almost one-third, one-third, one-third on the technology side. In
contrast, if we go to Russia, 33% petrol, 37% diesel and 0% electric, a completely different
landscape. And of course, in time, that will change as well. And we invested in the last five years
to have this technological flexibility to serve all markets. And maybe in two years or three years,there will be markets, which we will supply with 100% electromobility. And we are prepared for
that. We are not betting the farm on one technology because the markets are very different. And
this is now paying off that we invested huge sum, which is already behind us in flexibility to follow
the markets. And that is why the EUR3 million is not a target. This is our plan. Yeah.
And by looking at markets, looking on market intelligence, how do our customers develop, where
is wealth coming from. And that is a very robust statement and not a target, which is not able to
be achieved. But to answer your question, we continue to invest heavily in technologies. At the
same time, growing profitably. And at the end of this day, investing and growing profitably, they
belong together. It's part of the same equation. And starting from this year on, as you see, this
equation works for us really well.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Nicolas?
A - `Nicolas Peter, CFO & Member of Management Board `
Patrick, coming to your second question, guidance of EBIT in the automotive segment. On one
hand side, you are absolutely right. Our pricing power is excellent, and is excellent in what is
extremely important for us, not just in one market or in one region, we've seen a significant
improvement in, of course, in Asia, in the US, in the US, very much supported by the development
of the used car market and the US car leasing market. And during the first quarter 2020 and in
particular, in the first quarter '21, an improvement in Europe as well.
On the other hand side, if you look at commodities, I don't think we are -- we have a
disagreement that commodity prices are a headwind for our industry. And I've made earlier today
the comment that if we look at the our risk scenario, it would indicate that we have a mid to high
big three-digit million euro risk on the commodity side, while we have a positive impact on the
currency side.
So altogether, both together sum up to a risk of a negative deviation of EUR0.5 [ph] billion. Are
we motivated to further improve our pricing power? Of course. Of course, we are. And one of
the most important projects we are running in our performance program is to use digital tools in
an even better way to balance. This is maybe an additional comment to what Oliver just said to
balance in the perfect way, supply and demand. Because at the end of the day, it's about
managing supply and demand. We have probably the most flexible production system in our
industry. And with the quality of data, we have now available on VIN number level in every market,
I'm confident that we will continue to further improve the quality of our business.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Thank you very much, Patrick. Next question, please?
Operator
The next question is from `Jose Asumendi, Analyst, J.P. Morgan, J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Q - `Jose Asumendi, Analyst, J.P. Morgan `
Thank you very much, Max. It's Jose from J.P. Morgan. Couple of questions, please. The first one
for Oliver. Can you talk a little bit about the work you're doing on battery capacity in three maybe
topics? The first one, how do you think about in-sourcing all these battery cell manufacturing
capabilities in the coming years? Second, if you could just give us also some insights into the workyou are doing to develop sales or products for sales. And the third topic, the investment you
talked [ph] with Solid Power. I mean you're making, I think, a very bold statement to be able to
bring some proven technology in the coming years. So, I would be very interested to hear what
kind of work we're doing there. It does seem to me that you could be ahead of other European
competitors on the battery front. So any remarks you could give us there, that would be great.
Second maybe for Nicolas. A little bit more -- if you could comment a little bit more around the
earnings momentum on your Chinese joint venture for the coming quarters. It does sound like the
momentum continues to accelerate. Can you just give us a little bit of the tailwinds and
headwinds you see on the Chinese JV for the coming quarters. Thank you so much.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Thank you very much, Jose. We start with Oliver about the battery question.
A - `Oliver Zipse, Chairman `
Yeah. Jose, batteries, of course, is a really hot topic. But on the other hand, we are now in the
fifth generation of battery technology development. And so it's not completely new to us. We are
more or less doing almost everything in-house on the battery side, the full battery pack, the
battery modules, the electric drivetrain and so on. The only thing we are purchasing for a good
reason, and I'll come to that in a minute, is the battery cell itself, which is only one element of a
complete electric drivetrain. Why do we do that? There is this blended, very competent, rapidly
developing market out there. There are no monopoly structures and a lot of technology
development going on. There is no reason, from our point, whatsoever, to do that by yourself.
We have four large delivery contracts with CATL here in Europe and in China with EVE in China
from 2024 and with Northvolt here in Europe, and also with Samsung SDI. So we have four big
contracts, and that will serve us on the capacity side, but also on the technology side. So, we are
extremely happy with that. And we will have enough capacity to propel our growth further.
Now as we -- as you rightfully mentioned, we -- on May 4, we made a statement then that we
make an investment -- a strategic investment in Solid Power, together with other investors to
prepare ourselves for the next step. We're thinking more decades and not only in today's world.
We are working with Solid Power for quite some time. So it's not a new partner for us. And we
think that the ASSB, the all-solid-state battery technology is something promising for the future,
not for next year, but for the future, because the energy density is very promising.
And energy density means higher range and so on. So that is on our plate to develop that first.
And we are really happy to have, from our point of view, a strong partner there. And I think they
think of us as a strategic investor and we are heavily involved, as we said many times before, into
the technology development of battery cells for the future. So, we look with high expectation in
the future. And as we said before, electromobility is a big part of our strategy.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Thank you very much, Oliver. And now the second part of the question, BBA earnings outlook for
coming quarters?
A - `Oliver Zipse, Chairman `
Of course, you've asked about the earnings outlook for the coming quarters and more
specifically, of course, China and BBA. But maybe let me start with a more general comment. We
are, as we speak, mid of the second quarter and we are in a strong position in the secondquarter. Why? Because we have -- and that's not just China, we have a strong order bank in all
three major sales regions, China, US and Europe. In fact, we've seen that month after months,
Europe has developed in a positive way and we believe it will develop -- depend very, very much
on the development of the pandemic in Europe, how the business will continue to develop in
Europe.
Now if we reflect on China, we have seen since April last year, month after month, every single
month, an improvement of the business, improvement of the sales, while at the same time,
keeping the margins very high month after month, and it continued in the first quarter. If I'm more
specific about the second quarter, I expect the second quarter to be strong in China as well.
And we have no indications that it should significantly reverse in the second half of the year.
However, what will happen, of course, is you have a different base effect in the second half of the
year. In the first half, in particular, in the first quarter, we had the shutdown in China in February
and early March, and we had a very strong second half year in China already in 2020. So the
growth potential is a different one compared to Q1 and Q2.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Thank you. Next question, please?
Operator
The next question is from `Henning Cosman, Analyst, HSBC, HSBC. Your line is now open.
Q - `Henning Cosman, Analyst, HSBC `
Hi. Thank you very much, and good afternoon. I was hoping to speak about your three million unit
targets. I'm observing that most of your OEM competitors have abandoned their unit targets.
Some sort of explicitly saying they are not pursuing volume anymore in favor of cash and profit.
And of course, I hear you when you say you want to obviously grow profitably. But I just find it
curious that you're almost the last one left to have a specific unit target. So, I was hoping you
could please comment on that a little bit.
And then still on the guidance, I don't want to be too blunt, right? But when I hear you say that
you think Q2 will be very strong as well. And I'm sort of reading into that, that you're viewing it as
similar maybe to Q1 even when I consider the fact that your capitalization ratio will be much higher
than the remainder of the year than it was in Q1. I'm really wondering, also sort of considering
what Patrick said in your response about the pricing offsetting raw materials and so on. And would
really leave you with a very, very low implied second half. So if you could just maybe -- I don't
know if it's possible to quantify some of the specific effects that would really bring you under the
ceiling of the guidance range, that would be great. Thank you very much.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Oliver, you want to start? Yeah?
A - `Oliver Zipse, Chairman `
Yeah. Henning, as I said before, this is not volume versus profit. This is profitable growth and it's
not a target. I think we owe it to our investors to be transparent where we are heading to,
technology-wise, market share-wise, but also volume-wise. And this is our plan. Now, this is not a
target or a commitment that we have to push. If you look at the whole Pacific region on the
western and on the east side, this is rapidly developing. The United States is starting a boomingphase. You have all of the after COVID state subsidies, enormous amounts of sum. I hope that
will create wealth at the end of the day.
And of course, you see the Asian side developing, and it's not only China. And we are not so far
from this EUR3 million volume target. And I think we owe it to our investors to be transparent. And
in the past, maybe there was a target setting approach. This is not what we do here. We are
transparent about our plans. And we will see at the end of this year, maybe we are not -- that
plan is not even so far away anymore.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Nicola?
A - `Nicolas Peter, CFO & Member of Management Board `
Henning, if we put ourselves in the situation we were exactly 12 months ago when we were
discussing the situation in 2020, if I remember well, we had and you were joining our quarters
conference and we had a completely different discussion compared to what happened in the
second half of 2020. In the second half of 2020, we had our best sales result of the second half
year in the history of our company. And we have seen margins improving significantly. What did
we learn out of this that our today's environment is extremely volatile. It's extremely volatile. And
therefore, we are really focused on managing in the best possible way, supply and demand to be
able to follow the market in both directions. I think we have proven in Q3, Q4, Q1 that we are
performing very well in this regard. You've rightly mentioned the outlook for Q2.
And as I said, regarding the second half of the year, it will very much depend on the speed of
recovery in Europe. We are confident regarding US and Asia. And it's not just China, markets like
Korea are performing extremely well. And of course, you have to take into account, and I've
mentioned this in my speech that we have a growing demand for xEVs in our portfolio. And as we
both know, xEV, and we are really working hard to change this in the next couple of years, but still
have lower margin compared to an ICE engine. On the other hand side, we are really satisfied
that our xEV cars, our electrified cars, be it all-electric or plug-in hybrid are in such high demand.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Thank you very much, Nicolas. So, ladies and gentlemen, it's 3 o'clock, but I think we take two,
three more additional question. Yes, next question, please?
Operator
The next question is from `Daniel Schwarz, Analyst, Stifel, Stifel. Your line is now open.
Q - `Daniel Schwarz, Analyst, Stifel `
Yes. Thank you for taking my question. The question about residual values. So used car prices,
obviously, at peak levels. And still, you have not reversed provisions from last year. Could you say
what the reason for that is? And can you give an indication what the value is of off-lease vehicles
that come back to you every quarter?
And my second question is, as you mentioned, you are market leader in plug-in hybrids and of
course, that helps a lot to cut emissions. Do you think there's a risk that the EU will change the
regulation for these vehicles in June? Thank you.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental AffairsOliver, you would like to start with the plug-in hybrid question? I think, yes.
A - `Oliver Zipse, Chairman `
Yeah. Daniel, we are completely aware that there are a lot of discussions on the hybrid. But
looking at the market, it's one of the most fascinating product for customers. And there is one
epic truth about plug-in hybrids in terms of emissions, they're always better than a normal
combustion engine, always because of the recuperation capabilities. The discussion we have, we
-- there will be some adaptions in terms of what -- how is it measured on a test track and what's a
real assumption depending on whether you charge the car or not. We see that. But even if that is
changed, it will stay a highly attractive customer product, independent of the regulation. And so
we are quite happy about that progress. And as we said before, we are flexible. We can change
drivetrains and if it goes down, it goes down. And currently, it's working perfectly for us, really.
And if that goes down, again, we will do more best, yeah. It's not such a big problem.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Thank you, Oliver. Nicolas, about residual revenues?
A - `Nicolas Peter, CFO & Member of Management Board `
Daniel, first of all, you are absolutely right. The fact that used car markets are very supportive, has
a significant impact on our P&L, be it on -- in the Automotive segment and in the, of course, in the
Financial Services segment. If we look now at the impact in Q1, it's between a low and mid-3-digit
million euro number, the euro [ph] positive impact. And now you can, I guess, relatively easily
calculate because in particular, relevant is this effect in markets like US, markets like UK and
Germany, hardly any impact in China because China is not a leasing market. This is a really
significant improvement on a per vehicle level in those markets. If we reflect what we can see
right now, the situation is on this strong level, relatively stable in those three markets. And this is
why we are motivated with the right strategy regarding supply and demand to keep it on this
level.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Thank you very much. Next question, please?
Operator
The next question is from `Dorothee Cresswell, Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas, Exane. Your line is now open.
Q - `Dorothee Cresswell, Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas `
Hi, guys. And thanks for taking my question. It's a slightly longer-term one. There's obviously a lot
of new BEVs in the pipeline for 2022 and '23. I know you've officially only unveiled four of the
eight [ph] launches during those two years. But could you confirm so that some of those products
will be allocated to the Spartanburg plant and you say that there will be more pure electric
products being localized in China. And then I wondered if you had an order intake number on the
new iX, if you could share with us. Thank you.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Thank you, Dorothee. Oliver?
A - `Oliver Zipse, Chairman `Dorothee, hello from Munich. We communicated that there will be, at the end of 2023, we will
have 12 electric owning products more in all three brands; BMW, Rolls-Royce and also MINI. So, we
are only at a starting point where we try to cover all segments.
And our strategy is not to have individual cars, we cover all segments. Meaning if there is a
specific marking going quicker to emission-free mobility, we will be able to respond in all
segments at the same time. And that's around the corner. So next year, we will have the 7 series,
a high-profile product with all kinds of drivetrains. We will have the X1. We will have the 5 series
and so on. So, we're only at the very starting point there. There will be best cars, of course, like
the iX3 is produced in China and exported from there all over the world. And the pure electric
cars in the United States, that will take a little bit more time, but there will be also electric-only
cars at a later point in time in Spartanburg.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Nicola?
A - `Nicolas Peter, CFO & Member of Management Board `
Dorothee, may I add to the incoming on a level of the iX. To put it very simple, production 2021 is
sold out. So, we are really in a -- not only in a good position, but we are optimistic for this kind. We
are specifically optimistic because this car plays a key role in our strategy moving forward. This is
a segment which we dominated. This -- it's plus, minus the size of an X5. The X5 segment is a
segment, which BMW has dominated in the last, more than 15 years. And the feedback we got on
the iX make us very optimistic that we will continue the success story.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Thank you very much, Dorothee. And now the last question, please.
Operator
The last question is from `Philippe Houchois, Analyst, Jefferies, Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Q - `Philippe Houchois, Analyst, Jefferies `
Yes. Thank you very much. I have two questions, please. One for Nicolas, maybe. Lot of discussion
this earnings season about a world of low inventory, better pricing. And I'm just trying to maybe
get an answer from you on how we should look at it for the -- I know you control your
environment better than most at this stage. And if we think about, let's say, if you're able to
reduce your finished product inventories by, let's say, 10 days of sales, about how much would
you think you would have to increase your work in progress or your buffers in terms of days of
cost of goods sold to derisk the supply chain and would it [ph] repeat what we saw across the
industry. So if you have a view on the net impact, that would be very helpful.
And the other question I have is more for Dr. Zipse and more an industry question and your
quality of [ph] President of the ACEA. We're about to have a decision in the coming months about
Euro 7. And everything I read basically about Euro 7 tells me this is the kiss of death for ICE,
basically, from a technical standpoint. You may or may not agree. But I'm just wondering what -- is
it too late to see a scenario where we basically we scrap Euro 7. In exchange, the industry moves
towards a faster acceleration of electrification, particularly the build-out of charging infrastructure.
And if you could, is there an estimate somewhere that the ACEA has come up with what it would
cause the industry in Europe in terms of billions of euros to actually comply with Euro 7 as it isA - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Thank you, Philippe. We start with Nicolas and last words from Oliver?
A - `Nicolas Peter, CFO & Member of Management Board `
Philippe, we spent a lot of resources to improve in a very systematic way, the quality of our sales
and market forecast for every single individual market and for every single individual segment.
And thanks to this, we are, if you look -- if you compare end of Q1 inventory level to the previous
years, we operate our business with approximately 80,000 cars less in inventory, which is, I think,
very significant, but we will not stop there.
As I said, one of the most important projects, from my perspective, in our performance program
is really to further analyze and understand how we can further improve the inventory level on one
hand side, while at the same time, being also from a supplier perspective and very reliable
partner, which is able to forecast as early as possible deviations from an initial plan, be it on the
positive or on the negative side.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
Oliver?
A - `Oliver Zipse, Chairman `
Yeah, Philippe. That is a very important discussion because it's currently in the regulation phase.
And in due time, there will be decision on Euro 7. We must be careful not to mix up CO2 targets
and emission targets on the air pollutant side, which is Euro 7. They're quite distinct things. We are
very strong because there is a direct link between CO2 emissions and the climate because that is
a very strong thing. And that is why we agreed in the European automotive industry to be even
more progressive and to offer to be more progressive than a 37.5% reduction between 2021 and
2030. So, I think we are heading somewhere towards 50%, not to be confused with the 55% in
the overall climate gas discussion. The base of that is 1990. We are much, much more
progressive because our base starts at the end of this year and we are offering around about
50%. So, we are really progressive about that.
The EU 7 is not about emissions. It's about the emission effect of air pollutants. So in the term of
do no harm and some of these effects, we even propose to be tougher in EU 7 than we are
already in the very good EU 6d regulation. On the other hand, they are emissions. If you reduce
them further, there's almost no effect on air quality. And then it becomes a cost issue with no
reason. And what we see currently to -- and I'm often asked a question, why don't you skip EU 7
and go full electric? I think the charging infrastructure worldwide in Europe, not even in Germany is
in a state where we could make that prognosis. It's far away from being able to do 100% of
electric mobility. We are far away.
Currently, the number of electric cars, purely electric cars is increasing four-fold in comparison to
charging infrastructure. And it's increasing by the day. So we are far, far away, and I'm only talking
about climate and air pollution effects. The worst case is you ban the combustion engines, and
you do not have the charging infrastructure, you will very quickly see extremely old, and I say, dirty
cars driving around here.
You will have an Havana effect. You will have the old cars not being replaced. And that's why I
warn heavily to emit EU 7. We are not offering to postpone that. We want to do EU 7, but with the
right strategy to increase air quality and to have a right balance to have a cost ratio benefit. Andthen I think we can improve the combustion engines further with EU 7, maybe in 2025, 2026,
whatever. But I would not play -- the CO2 reduction targets, I would not play them off with EU 7.
They're quite different things.
Q - `Philippe Houchois, Analyst, Jefferies `
Right. Okay. Thank you very much.
A - `Maximilian Schoberl, EVP of Corporate & Governmental Affairs
