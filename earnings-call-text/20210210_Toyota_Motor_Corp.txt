Presentation
Operator
Thank you very much for participating today despite your busy schedule.We will now begin the
financial results briefing for Q3 of the fiscal year ended March 2021 for TOYOTA MOTOR
CORPORATION.To begin with, I would like to introduce the attendees.I am `Jun Nagata, Operating Officer, Chief Communication Officer, Executive
Officer.I am `Kenta Kon, Member of the Board of Directors, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial, Executive Officer.Now, I will explain the overview of our financial results.
`Kenta Kon, Member of the Board of Directors, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial `
This is Kon.Thank you very much for joining our earnings briefing today.First, we are still continuing
the battle against COVID-19.We would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who
supports our daily lives, especially those in medicine.We would also like to express our deepest
gratitude to customers around the world who patronize Toyota vehicles, and to our shareholders,
dealerships, and suppliers who support our corporate activities.First, I would like to explain our
results for the nine-month cumulative period from April to December 2020.The consolidated
sales volume for the current period was 5,438,000 units, which was 79.3% compared to the
same period of the previous year.This is primarily due to the spread of COVID-19 in each
region.Additionally, Toyota and Lexus sales volume was 6,627,000 units, which is 89.5% of the
same period last year.Regarding the trend in Toyota and Lexus sales volume, globally it has been
steadily recovering since April, which was the bottom, and since September, it has continued to
exceed 100% YoY.Regarding the regional trends, they are as described in the document.I would
like to express my gratitude once again to our customers who have patronized Toyota vehicles,
as well as to our dealerships, suppliers, and all stakeholders who have made continuous efforts to
deliver as many vehicles as possible to meet customer demands.Consolidated financial results
for the current period were operating revenue of JPY19.5252 trillion, operating income of
JPY1.5079 trillion, profit before tax of JPY1.8699 trillion, and profit of JPY1.4680 trillion.I will now
explain the factors behind the change in operating income.Foreign exchange rate fluctuations
resulted in a decrease in profit of JPY175 billion.Cost improvement efforts resulted in a profit
increase of JPY100 billion.On the sales side, the impact was a profit decrease of JPY615 billion,
mainly due to the reduction in unit sales caused by the spread of the new coronavirus.Changes in
miscellaneous expenses and cost reduction efforts resulted in a profit increase of JPY85 billion.As
a result, operating income excluding the effects of foreign exchange rates and swap valuation
gains and losses decreased by JPY430 billion.Regarding our quarterly performance, we posted a
decrease in profit from April to June and from July to September, but for the October to
December period, we turned to profit growth due to operational efforts and other
factors.Regarding operating income by region, although we experienced a decrease in profit
mainly due to reduced sales volume associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, looking at the most
recent three months, all regions have achieved profit growth.I will now explain our China businessand Financial Services segment.First, regarding our China business, operating income of
consolidated subsidiaries was JPY178.0 billion, up JPY75.8 billion compared to the same period
last year due to operational efforts.Equity in earnings of affiliated companies was JPY113.9 billion,
up JPY25.0 billion YoY due to operational efforts.For the Financial Services segment, operating
income was JPY355.3 billion, up JPY50.6 billion YoY due to factors such as decreased residual
value costs and expanded lending margins.Next, I will explain the outlook for the fiscal year
ended March 2021.For consolidated sales volume, we have revised the forecast to 7.6 million
units, an increase of 100,000 units from our November outlook.For the regional breakdown, it is
as shown in the document.For Toyota and Lexus sales volume, we expect 8.9 million units, which
is an increase of 300,000 units from the forecast in November.For Q4 Toyota and Lexus sales
volume, we expect approximately 110% of the same period in the previous year.Next, regarding
our consolidated financial results forecast.We have set our foreign exchange rate assumptions
from January onward at USD1 = JPY100 and EUR1 = JPY125, making our full-year foreign exchange
rate assumptions USD1 = JPY105 and EUR1 = JPY123.For the full-year earnings forecast, we expect
operating revenue of JPY26.5 trillion, operating income of JPY2.0 trillion, profit before tax of
JPY2.55 trillion, and Profit of JPY1.9 trillion.Next, I would like to explain the factors behind the
changes in operating income.We have revised our full-year forecast upward by JPY700 billion
from our November outlook to JPY2 trillion.The breakdown is as shown here.The factors affecting
the increase and decrease in operating income compared to the previous period are as shown
here.The current COVID-19 infection situation and other factors still make the outlook
uncertain.While continuing to monitor risks, we will make further efforts with everyone involved
through company-wide earning improvement activities and production and sales initiatives. At the
same time, we will steadily continue to sow seeds for the future and accelerate
transformation.This concludes the financial results presentation.

Q - Unverified Participant
I am Chiba from Asahi Shimbun.Thank you for your assistance.Regarding the upward revision, I
would like to ask two questions to get more details about the factors contributing to the sales
increase and the factors that improved the corporate structure.First, looking at regional profits
over three months, I believe that operating profit margins have increased in North America,
Japan, and Asia.Could you please explain in more detail, by region, what factors have contributed
to the increase in operating profit margins in each market?Please go ahead.This is the first
question.For my second question, regarding the upward revision of operating income, the cost
improvement efforts amount to JPY185 billion compared to the previous fiscal year.How should
we interpret this number? I believe it includes variable costs, but compared to the previous year, I
think it's about break-even.Could you please share your efforts on cost improvement initiatives
this term, and provide your evaluation and assessment of how these efforts have resulted in the
current figures?Based on that, I would appreciate if you could provide your comments on how
you view the Q3 financial results.I will now respond.A - `Kenta Kon, Member of the Board of Directors, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial `
Thank you for your question.First, I would like to explain the financial results from Kon.First,
regarding the factors that contributed to the upward revision and increase in sales, the profit
margins have improved on a three-month basis in Japan, Asia, and North America. I would like to
explain what factors are behind this improvement.I am currently displaying the slide that shows
the three-month operating income by region.As Mr. Chiba mentioned, all regions have shown
profit growth when looking at these three months.Operating profit margins are also improving
compared to last year as shown in the red figures below, for example, Japan at 12.3% and North
America at 6.8%.Regarding Japan, the biggest factor is indeed the impact on sales.We estimate
that this will have an impact of about JPY150 billion.The situation is the same for North
America.We are also seeing the impact on sales, primarily in terms of volume and model mix.Each
region, including Asia, is showing similar trends. Within Asia, which includes China, Southeast Asia,
and South Asia, the profit increase of JPY70 billion is roughly split evenly between China and
ASEAN countries.Particularly in China, we are seeing very positive trends in terms of sales impact,
including increased sales volume, price revisions, and product mix.Looking at a quick breakdown
by market, those are the key highlights.For the cost improvement, may I display the slide showing
the factors contributing to changes in the full-year outlook?Please show us the slide that
compares with the previous fiscal year instead.This is it, thank you.We have indicated our cost
improvement efforts as JPY185 billion.Regarding this, we are aiming for cost improvement efforts
of approximately JPY300 billion gross impact annually.In comparison, this JPY185 billion is
approximately JPY200 billion gross, excluding the impact of rising material costs.Therefore, this is
slightly less than in a normal period.This is because our consolidated sales volume for the full year
has decreased by over one million units. Although our cost improvement efforts have been
significant, with both our operations team and suppliers working very hard, the lower sales
volume has made it somewhat more difficult to achieve these improvements.We believe that
there are certain areas where improvements are more difficult to achieve due to the decreased
operations in H1.However, overall, if I explain our assessment of Q3, including what I just
mentioned, as Mr. Chiba pointed out, operating income was JPY13.9 billion in Q1, JPY506.0 billion
in Q2, and JPY980.0 billion in Q3. While there is a question of how meaningful it is to look at such
short three-month periods, we believe it is true that we have been gradually recovering.This is
the result of Chairman Toyoda setting a benchmark of 8 million vehicle sales and JPY500 billion in
operating income at the beginning of the fiscal year, and together with all stakeholders, we have
been working diligently to achieve these targets, simply focusing on doing what needs to be
done.When I spoke with Chairman Toyoda about the financial results in advance, he specifically
asked me to express our sincere gratitude to all our stakeholders and to the 5.5 million people
involved in the automotive industry.He mentioned that there were such efforts.These are the
results of our ongoing efforts since the Lehman crisis, as well as the efforts we have made over
the past year to review and implement the basics in response to the current situation. I believe
this financial performance reflects those efforts.I apologize for taking so much time. That
concludes my presentation.
Q - Unverified Participant
Thank you.I have just one question regarding North America. When we asked about it during the
interim financial results, you explained that incentives were decreasing. Is this situation still
continuing?If incentives are decreasing, what would be the factors behind this?I apologize for the
interruption.
A - `Kenta Kon, Member of the Board of Directors, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial `Regarding incentives, the total amount decreased in Q1 and Q2 due to the decline in unit
sales.The incentive per unit has been kept very low, and the total amount has decreased due to
the decline in unit sales.In Q3, as the number of units has increased in North America as well, the
total amount has not decreased significantly. We are maintaining a situation where the incentive
per unit remains at a very low level.Therefore, the factors in North America are indeed volume
and mix, or composition.The SUV ratio has reached a significantly high level compared to the
past, and this is having an impact.Additionally, there is a finance company called TMCC located in
North America. Currently, used car prices in North America are at very high levels.A few years
ago, our North American finance business was consolidated with the automotive business at
Plano, where our North American headquarters is located. Since then, we have been working
diligently to improve communication and strengthen collaboration with the automotive business,
which is one factor.Additionally, we have continuously revised our lease residual value
assumptions conservatively, enhancing the health of our assets.Furthermore, we have maintained
strict credit management since the Lehman shock, which has resulted in very healthy assets.
Combined with these efforts and the current high used car prices, costs related to residual values
and bad debts have decreased significantly, contributing to our profit growth.

Thank you, Mr. Chiba.Let's move on to the next question.Now, we move to Mr. Katori from Yomiuri
Shimbun newspaper.Thank you.When your video appears on the screen after we switch the
display, please begin your comments.We are now switching the screen.Thank you for waiting, Mr.
Catri.
Q - Unverified Participant
I am Katori from The Yomiuri Shimbun. Thank you for having me.My first question is about the
China business in the regional breakdown. Looking at the most recent January figures, Toyota
and Lexus sales have grown by about 30%, which shows they are selling extremely well. Could
you please elaborate on why sales are growing so strongly there?My second question is about
the second upward revision of this fiscal year's forecast. Starting from the production cuts in the
spring to this second upward revision, I believe you have been implementing various initiatives
including structural reforms, work style reforms, sales efforts, and other measures.Could you
please explain more specifically what factors contributed to this beyond just the increase in
vehicle volume?That's all.
A - `Kenta Kon, Member of the Board of Directors, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial `
Now, regarding China, first, about why we are seeing growth there.As Ms. Catholi pointed out,
our sales in China in January 2021 have increased by approximately 30%.Currently, as stated in
our profit situation, we can clearly see the positive effects of new models when viewed by vehicle
type.Newly introduced models, main models such as Camry and Corolla, Corolla's sister model
Levin, as well as RAV4 and its sister model Wildlander - these newly launched vehicles are
steadily gaining sales volume and earning customer loyalty.As for Lexus, global volume models
such as ES, RX, and NX are also receiving strong customer support.Of course, this includes our
efforts to maintain very lean inventory and lean incentives in our sales approach, so it cannot be
simply stated in one way. However, including such efforts, the residual value or high market
valuation of Toyota vehicles in the used car market is gradually becoming common knowledgeburden or more favorable payments when replacing their vehicles.This is certainly due to quality
aspects, and also the strength of Toyota vehicles in the used car market and used car prices. This
includes quality factors, as well as ease of repair, accessibility of parts, and the inherent durability
of the vehicles.I believe these factors are being appreciated once again, which is contributing to
our sales.Later, I would like to have `Jun Nagata, Operating Officer, Chief Communication Officer, who is in charge of domestic sales, provide
additional information about sales.Additionally, regarding the second upward revision, while we
had production cuts in early spring, we have seen a recovery from that.I believe there were
various efforts, but this truly cannot be expressed in just a few words.Of course, this was not just
our effort, but truly includes our dealerships, suppliers, transport operators, and everyone
working at gas stations. I strongly feel that everyone has been working together with the mission
of economic recovery, which is the mission of our automotive industry.To be specific, we simply
did what should be naturally done. However, it was truly challenging to launch new vehicles as
scheduled, such as nine models this year and ten models last year, as if it were a routine
matter.However, the fact that we were able to actually do this.Additionally, in spring, especially in
Japan where we had no operations, we concentrated on VA activities during non-operating days,
which is essentially searching for cost improvement opportunities, as we worked hard to be
productive despite the situation.We did things like that, or visited our suppliers to similarly search
for cost improvement opportunities.We made masks and face shields while working, and as a
result, when operations recovered significantly in the second half, we were able to maintain high
operating rates with very lean fixed costs.During that time, with a strong determination not to halt
the economy, we have been providing various forms of support. This includes helping to raise
productivity in protective clothing manufacturing, and currently assisting manufacturers with
bottleneck processes in vaccine refrigerators. We have also been supporting vaccine
administration efficiency improvements - in the US and UK where people were forming lines, we
analyzed time requirements at each station and introduced Toyota's specialty, the Toyota
Production System (TPS) thinking, to significantly streamline these operations.While doing these
things, we have continued to make various efforts.Let me ask `Jun Nagata, Operating Officer, Chief Communication Officer to provide
supplementary information regarding sales.
A - `Jun Nagata, Operating Officer, Chief Communication Officer `
This is `Jun Nagata, Operating Officer, Chief Communication Officer.Let me add a few details about sales. In early spring, when COVID-19 hit, we
really had no clear picture of what sales volume we could expect worldwide. That's why President
Toyoda announced JPY500 billion as a reference figure at the beginning of the fiscal year, and
similarly set eight million units as our sales target.Even within our global sales, for example in
Japan which I am responsible for, we've established standard sales volume targets not just for
Japan as a country but for each region and individual dealership, and we review these figures
weekly through a rolling forecast to see how the numbers are tracking.We carefully and
meticulously examine each case to see how it relates to inventory.This may be stating the
obvious, but we have been carefully observing these factors and conducting our business
thoroughly.Additionally, as the sales performance naturally varies by model, some plants have
vehicles that are difficult to sell or less popular during certain seasons. To minimize the
operational differences between plants, we implemented detailed sales measures and worked
to boost sales volumes for these models.Furthermore, online sales have particularly advanced
globally during the COVID-19 pandemic.This is regardless of region. It's about how we can reach
customers without contact and receive orders from them.Additionally, there were significant
challenges in the area of payments, so we are focusing on how to connect online services with
financial products to provide customers with more accessible programs and services.Also, when
customers come in for maintenance and inspections, we have taken measures such as using
disinfectants (like what is called "Cleverin" in Japan) to ensure customers feel safe before they
leave. I believe our global dealership network has made every effort to respond to theseneeds.Indeed, in this sense, I believe this period may have been a time when each individual
considered what customers want, what they care about, and what concerns them, allowing us to
take small actions accordingly. I think this applies to our sales activities as well.To add a
supplementary point regarding the activities of our employees and various stakeholders, I think
one of the biggest factors was the significant change in how we communicate with each other.To
be specific, President Toyoda, as the top executive, significantly changed how he communicates
with employees and stakeholders, particularly in the online environment.To be more specific,
internally, we have been holding a weekly executive meeting that includes the President since
before or from the old days.Before COVID-19, we basically held meetings with those who could
gather in the conference room in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture. However, when COVID-19 hit, we
were able to connect online, so we invited global executives, especially CEOs from each region,
to join these meetings.This has really had a positive effect on internal communication, enabling
quick decision-making and information sharing during the COVID-19 situation.Additionally, we
actually hold a global conference once every four years where we present our medium-term
strategy for the next four years.Last year was supposed to be the year we would hold it, but
unfortunately due to COVID-19, we were unable to have our face-to-face global conference.This
time, President Toyoda recorded various mid-term strategies on video, packaged them, and
distributed them to everyone globally, and they watched them.In the past, approximately 1,000
to 1,500 people, mainly top executives from global business entities and dealerships, would
attend this global convention in person to receive such messages.However, this time, since we
had online videos and other materials available, a total of 50,000 people, including employees,
were able to view this medium-term strategy.Actually, I think this was very effective. I believe one
of the factors that allows our employees and stakeholders to calmly focus on their current work is
that they now clearly understand, "Oh, so this is what Toyota will become in the future." This
understanding of our future direction has become an important element in enabling everyone to
work with composure on immediate tasks.Additionally, Toyota Times has been broadcasting in
English since last April, and including such initiatives, the page views have increased
significantly.We have seen approximately double the page views compared to last year, and from
2019 to 2020, page views doubled, so I believe this has been particularly effective as an internal
communication tool.Changing the subject a bit, at the beginning of this year, as the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association, we ran a TV commercial expressing our gratitude to the
550 million people involved in the automotive industry, as Kon mentioned earlier. About a week
later, as the Chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, Mr. Toyoda expressed
a message of gratitude to these 550 million people.This is truly solely thanks to our automotive
industry, which consists of five automotive associations.We have five associations, including OEMs
and parts manufacturers, with a total of 2 million people.However, this is not just limited to our
group. It was also thanks to the 5.5 million people working in transportation and at gas stations
who continued to work hard even during the COVID-19 pandemic that we were able to achieve
these financial results. We implemented this measure as an expression of our gratitude to
them.As a result, we received sincere gratitude from the 5.5 million people working at gas
stations and in transportation. I believe this could become a significant catalyst that will help
address various challenges, including carbon neutrality for all kinds of vehicles in the future.In this
way, we truly feel that changing this kind of communication has become a significant source of
strength for us - though it might be strange to call it a "discovery" - during this COVID-19
pandemic.That is all from me.

OperatorThank you, Ms. Catori.Now, let's move on to the next question.Mr. Noguchi from NHK.Please go
ahead.I will switch the display. Please begin speaking when you see your video on the screen.We
are currently switching the screen.Thank you for waiting, Mr. Noguchi.Please go ahead.
Q - Unverified Participant
This is Noguchi from NHK. Thank you for your time.I have two points, which may be somewhat
unrelated to the financial results.First, regarding the recent global shortage of semiconductors for
automobiles, how do you view its impact?Please let us know if there is any current impact and
what the outlook is going forward.That is my first point.My second point is completely unrelated
to the financial results. It concerns the remarks by Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Organizing
Committee Chairman Mori that could be interpreted as discriminatory against women.I believe
your company is a sponsor of the Games. How do you perceive these remarks?Thank you.
A - `Kenta Kon, Member of the Board of Directors, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial `
First, I will respond regarding our semiconductor situation.The semiconductor situation is very
tight globally, and our company is in the same situation.However, this does not mean that we are
experiencing any significant production cuts at present.However, this doesn't mean that we will
be fine indefinitely going forward.Indeed, we still consider this as a risk, so we are communicating
daily, weekly, and monthly not only with our tier one suppliers but also with conductor
manufacturers and semiconductor companies to thoroughly assess the situation on a daily and
weekly basis.Regarding the outlook, while there are opinions that the current situation might
continue until around summer, based on our confirmations with our procurement department and
suppliers, we feel it may not last that long.That is our current situation.For the second question, I'll
turn it over to `Jun Nagata, Operating Officer, Chief Communication Officer.
A - `Jun Nagata, Operating Officer, Chief Communication Officer `
Now, in response to Chairman Mori's comments, I would like to address your question by sharing
President Toyoda's comments.TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION is a global company that was
born in Japan and has grown with the support of many people around the world.We are
conducting business activities worldwide with the aim of becoming the best company in town that
can bring smiles to the faces of the townspeople who have been very supportive of us.Just as we
cherish our hometown and home country, we also value Earth, the home planet of all humanity.
We continue our daily efforts to achieve our SDGs targets.This is the very spirit of the Olympics
and Paralympics, which aim to create a peaceful and non-discriminatory society through sports, a
society where everyone can participate.We sympathize with this spirit, which is why we decided to
become a sponsor of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.However, we deeply regret that the
recent remarks made by the leader of the Games Organizing Committee differ from the values
that we at TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION have always cherished.This concludes the
comments from Toyota.We have engaged in extensive internal discussions and consultations
regarding this matter.Based on this, we determined that we should not remain silent in this
situation, as it was important for us to ensure the world correctly understands what Toyota values
and how we view the world. That is why we decided to release President Toyota's comment on
this matter.That concludes my response.

Thank you.
OperatorThank you, Mr. Noguchi.Now, let's move on to the next question.Mr. Kikawa from Toyo
Keizai.Please go ahead.When your video appears on the screen after the display changes, please
begin speaking.We are currently switching the display.Thank you for your patience, Mr./Ms.
Kikawa.Please go ahead.
Q - Unverified Participant
I am Kikawa from Toyo Keizai.I have two points.My first point relates to the semiconductor
shortage for automobiles that was mentioned earlier. Currently, while the situation remains quite
tight, we are addressing it on a daily basis.Compared to other companies, especially Japanese
OEMs, I believe your company's impact has been quite limited. What do you think is the
background or reason why the impact of the semiconductor shortage has remained limited for
your company?During the Great East Japan Earthquake, the Japanese automotive industry was
severely impacted by damage to Renesas Electronics' factory. I imagine the lessons learned from
that experience have been reflected in various forms of Business Continuity Planning (BCP).
Could you please share your analysis of the factors and background regarding this situation?
Additionally, one more point concerns the accelerating trend of electrification. The Japanese
government has a policy of making all new vehicle sales electric vehicles by 2035.How will you
approach the electrification of mini vehicles, which is also inevitably unavoidable for Daihatsu
Motor Co., Ltd., a company under your umbrella?I believe introducing hybrid technology would be
a more realistic solution. Could you share your current thoughts on this matter?Thank you for your
assistance.
A - `Kenta Kon, Member of the Board of Directors, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial `
Regarding the semiconductor matter, I apologize for not providing sufficient explanation earlier.As
Mr. Kikawa just mentioned, following the Lehman shock and reflecting on that experience where
supply was disrupted in many areas, we have been building up our RESCUE system to thoroughly
cover not only Tier 1 but all levels of suppliers in our supply chain.As a continuous initiative, we
have been working on visualizing where potential risks may exist as part of what we call our initial
response mechanism.When we investigate with our suppliers to understand why the current
situation has developed, we find that on our suppliers' side, we have what could be considered a
relatively high degree of certainty.We provide a relatively certain production plan on a monthly
basis, for the next few months, or for a longer term of up to three years.We have maintained
continuous communication with our suppliers by repeating this process.Another aspect of our
BCP response was maintaining semiconductor inventory ranging from one to four months
depending on the component, although the duration varies for different parts.That is the second
point.The third point is that in this truly tight situation, we cannot accomplish everything with the
RESCUE system alone, so we will maintain close coordination with our suppliers, not just tier-one
manufacturers, but also including manufacturers further up the supply chain.According to our
Purchasing Division, they would hold about ten conference calls per day, maintaining this level of
communication especially during times of tight supply constraints.Based on various feedback
we've heard, our orders are considered to be very reliable.We believe that continuously
maintaining these practices has formed a strong foundation for our relationships with suppliers,
which has been particularly valuable during these challenging times.
Q - Unverified Participant
Mr. Kon, regarding semiconductors, there is currently a competition for microcontrollers between
the electronics industry and particularly the gaming console industry, where stay-at-home
demand has increased. With reports that some semiconductor manufacturers will raise prices, do
you have any concerns about these price increases?A - `Kenta Kon, Member of the Board of Directors, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial `
I think there will be a certain degree of price increases.This is about the gaming industry. While
there is certainly competition for resources, what's important is what kind of semiconductors are
actually being used.Indeed, when it comes to consumer products such as smartphones, games,
and other electronic devices, the semiconductors used in those applications are often not exactly
the same as those used in our industry.Therefore, in terms of how semiconductor manufacturers
allocate their chips, I believe it's ultimately about communication.I believe it's about clearly
communicating how many chips will be needed over the next one, two, and three years, not just
with tier-one suppliers but also including tier-two, tier-three, and tier-four manufacturers.
Q - Unverified Participant
Please tell us about electrification as well.
A - `Kenta Kon, Member of the Board of Directors, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial `
Electrification.`Jun Nagata, Operating Officer, Chief Communication Officer will provide additional information later if necessary.We definitely need
to proceed with the electrification of kei cars.Conversely, regarding electrification, within the
Toyota Group, TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION is currently the most proficient.Indeed, while
there are discussions about Toyota's technology being expensive when applied to kei cars, or
concerns about using it as is, we naturally share core technologies and utilize those that can be
applied to kei cars, which I believe is part of leveraging our group's collective strengths.First,
regarding hybrid vehicles, our long-term view about the need to provide electric vehicles that
customers will truly choose has not changed at all.We will follow that policy for kei cars as well.

Thank you, Mr. Kikawa.As we still have some questions and we're approaching our scheduled end
time, we'll take just one more person.Then we have Mr. Osada from Chunichi Shimbun.Please go
ahead.When your video appears on the screen after we switch displays, please begin
speaking.We are currently switching the display.Thank you for waiting, Mr. Nagata.Please go
ahead.
Q - Unverified Participant
I'm Osada from the Chunichi Shimbun.Thank you very much today.This may be somewhat
unrelated to the financial results and the numbers, but please allow me to ask this question.I
believe this term shows a clear recovery trend, but I think the financial results were somewhat
different from normal due to the COVID-19 pandemic.This may be something I should ask during
the annual results announcement, but I would like to take this opportunity to ask. After more than
a year in this COVID-19 pandemic, with various work style reforms and responses to
semiconductor shortages as mentioned earlier, and while facing new concerns, I believe your
initiatives with suppliers have accelerated. After experiencing this year of COVID-19, I think work
styles must have changed significantly both inside and outside your company.In your company's
case, there is the famous phrase "genchi genbutsu" (go and see), and you have been going on-
site to see things firsthand. As you mentioned, that has also changed in form, becoming more
online-based.Similarly, I was wondering if relationships with suppliers have changed in a similar
way, or perhaps how you approach cost engineering and procurement methods. You mentionedclose coordination earlier, so I'm curious if these practices might also be changing.If there is
anything more you could tell us about these areas, I would really appreciate hearing about
it.Thank you very much.
A - `Kenta Kon, Member of the Board of Directors, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial `
Thank you.First of all, as Mr. `Jun Nagata, Operating Officer, Chief Communication Officer mentioned, our work style is changing.While this doesn't
explain everything, for example, at our Toyota headquarters where we are now, the office
attendance rate is approximately 60-something percent.In Nagoya, the office attendance rate is
about 30-something percent, and in Tokyo it's about 15%. Remote work, while of course having
many challenges, has become well-established.Another point about the principle of being on-site
and hands-on: the cost we spent on overseas business trips last year was several tens of billions
of yen (several hundred million dollars).As Mr. Nagata mentioned, although we were going to the
sites based on the principle of being on-site and hands-on, this year we have reduced such trips
by about 99% for TMC alone, meaning we are hardly traveling at all.Looking at what we were
doing when we went to the sites, I realize there were many business trips that in retrospect seem
unnecessary. However, I believe it remains fundamentally important for our TMC craftsmen—our
master technicians—to be physically present during critical moments such as equipment
installation or final adjustments during transitions. Having these skilled technicians on-site to
properly complete the final steps continues to be the best approach.However, nowadays we are
changing our work style by using cameras to livestream or remotely monitor operations, focusing
our in-person presence only on the most critical aspects.Regarding our relationship with suppliers,
I'm not sure if I should say this, but our basic relationship with suppliers is primarily with tier one
suppliers.As for beyond that, we have been entrusting the tier one suppliers to properly manage
and monitor it.Regarding this year, of course, the suppliers are also in a very difficult
situation.There have been times when operations were running at lower capacity and times of
extremely high load, so we checked the business and revenue conditions of approximately
10,000 Tier2 suppliers through our Tier1 suppliers.I believe this is a completely new
engagement.This is what has changed over the past year in terms of our relationship with
suppliers.In addition, regarding SSA, it seems that while we were not explicitly demanding it, our
suppliers were rejecting parts with even the slightest flaws because they were supplying to
TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION, thinking they needed to provide only perfect items due to
what they perceived as our extremely high quality requirements.Conversely, by adopting a genchi
genbutsu (go and see) approach in such cases, we can determine what is actually acceptable.We
sent our technicians to assess parts that had previously been rejected, determining that they
were actually acceptable for use at Toyota.As a result, from the suppliers' perspective, Toyota
employees were previously faceless and somewhat intimidating figures. However, now that they
can see our faces and feel reassured that "this is acceptable for Toyota," I sense that this has
accelerated cost reduction activities.I believe this is not an exhaustive answer, but I will provide
you with a few examples.
