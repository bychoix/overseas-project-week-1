Q1 2025 Earnings Call

Presentation
`Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2025 Q&A Webcast. My name
is `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer, `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer,
and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time
in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These
comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results
could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in
our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call,
please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the Raise Hand button to join
the question queue.
Before we jump into Q&A, Elon will be providing an update. Elon?
`Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Hello, everyone. Well, it's never a dull moment these days. Well, thanks for sure. Every day is
going to be exciting. As people know, there's been some blowback for the time that I've been
spending in government with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. I think the
work that we're doing there is actually very important for trying to rein in the insane deficit that is
hitting our country, the United States to destruction, and the DOGE team has made a lot of
progress in addressing waste and fraud, but a natural blowback from that is those who were
receiving the wasteful dollars and the fraudulent dollars will try to attack me and DOGE team and
anything associated with me.
So, then I'm really left with two choices. We just let the waste and fraud continue, and it wasfight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track. And I believe the right
thing to do is to fight the waste and fraud and get the country back on the right track, and
working together with President Trump and his administration, because if the ship of America
goes down, we all go down with it, including Tesla and everyone else. So, I think this is critical
work.
The protests that you'll see out there, they're very organized, they're paid for, they're obviously
not going to say -- admit that the reason that they're protesting is because they're receiving
fraudulent money or that they're the recipients of wasteful largess, but they're going to think and
come up with some other reason. But that is -- the real reason for the protests, the actual reason
is that those receiving the waste and fraud wish to continue receiving it. That is the real thing
that's going on here, obviously.
So now that said, I do think there's the large slug of work necessary to get the DOGE team in
place and working in the government to get the financial house in order is mostly done. And I
think starting probably next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly. I'll
have to continue doing it for, I think, probably the remainder of the President's term, just to make
sure that the waste and fraud that we stopped does not come roaring back, which will do if it has
the chance. So, I think I'll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as
long as the President would like me to do so and as long as it is useful, but starting next month, I'll
be allocating far more of my time to Tesla and now that the major work of establishing the
Department of Government Efficiency is done.
So, at Tesla, we've gone through many, many a crisis over the years, and actually, been through
many near-death -- many near-death experiences, like we're probably on the ragged edge of
death at least maybe a dozen times. It's been so many times. This is not one of those times.
We're not on the ragged edge of death, not even close. So, there are some challenges and I
expect that this year will be -- there will probably be some unexpected bumps this year. I remain
extremely optimistic about the future of the company.
The future of the company is fundamentally based on large-scale autonomous cars and large-
scale, in large volume, vast numbers of autonomous humanoid robots. So, the value of a
company that makes truly useful autonomous humanoid robots and autonomous useful vehicles
at scale at low cost, which is what Tesla is going to do, is staggering. I continue to believe that
Tesla, with excellent execution, will be the most valuable company in the world by far. That's an
important if; we must execute well. But if we do execute well, I think Tesla will be the most
valuable company in the world by far. It may be as valuable as the next five companies combined.
So, there will be a few bumps along the road before that happens.
I said, I think, on the last earnings call that we'll start to see the prosperity of autonomy take
effect in a material way around the middle of next year. We still expect -- we expect to kind of be
selling fully autonomous rides in June in Austin, as we've been saying for now several months. So
that does continue. But the real question from a financial standpoint is when does it really
become material and affect the bottom line of the company and start to be a fundamental part
of the -- when does it move the financial needle in a significant way? That's probably around the
middle of next year, second half of next year. And then once it does start to move the financial
needle in a significant way, it will really go exponential from there.
So, that's -- I'd encourage people to look beyond like the -- some sort of bumps and potholes of
the road immediately ahead of us. But left your gaze to the bright shining sort of a doll on a hill, I
don't know, some Reagan-esque imagery. And that's where we're headed. And not too distant
future, like I said, in the next year or two. So, let's see.With respect to supply chain risk, something that Tesla has been working on for several years is
to localize supply chains. Does it actually make sense from a cost standpoint from -- and from a
logistics risk standpoint, is to have the supply chains be at least located on the continent in which
the car is built. And so we are, I think, the least company -- the least affected car company with
respect to tariffs, at least in most respects. I mean, it remains to be seen. Now, tariffs are still
tough on a company when margins are still low. But we do have localized supply chains in both
America, Europe, and China. So that's -- that puts us in a stronger position than any of our
competitors.
And undoubtedly, I'm going to get a lot of questions about tariffs. And I just want to emphasize
that the tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in with my
advice with the President, which he will listen to my advice, but then it's up to him, of course, to
make his decision. I've been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are
generally a good idea for prosperity, but this decision is fundamentally up to the elected
representative of the people being the President of the United States. So, I'll continue to
advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that's all I can do, so.
Now let me walk you through why I'm so excited about the future of Tesla. So, first of all,
autonomy. The team and I are laser focused on bringing Robotaxi to Austin in June. Unsupervised
autonomy will first be solved for the Model Y in Austin, and then -- actually, we should parse out
the terms for robotic taxi or Robotaxi and just generally like what's the Cybercab, because we've
got a product called the Cybercab, and then any Tesla, which could be an S, 3, X, or Y that is
autonomous, is a robotic taxi or Robotaxi. It's very confusing. So, the vast majority of the Tesla
fleet that we've made is capable of being a Robotaxi or robotic taxi.
And as we -- we're going from -- once we can make the whole system work, where you can have
paid rides fully autonomously with no one in the car in one city, that is a very scalable thing for us
to go broadly within whatever jurisdiction allows us to operate. So, because what we're resolving
for is a general solution to autonomy, not a city-specific solution for autonomy, once we make it
work in a few cities, we can basically make it work in all cities in that legal jurisdiction. So, if it's --
once we can make it work in a few cities in America, we can make it work anywhere in America.
Once we can make it work in a few cities in China, we can make it work anywhere in China,
likewise in Europe, limited only by regulatory approvals. So, this is the advantage of having a
generalized solution using artificial intelligence and the -- an AI chip that Tesla designed
specifically for this purpose, as opposed to very expensive sensors and high-precision maps of a
particular neighborhood, where that neighborhood may change, or often changes, and then the
car stops working. So, we have a general solution instead of a specific solution. Yes.
And we've got Optimus. We're making good progress in Optimus. We expect to have thousands
of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of this year, going years forward. And we
expect to scale Optimus up faster than any product, I think, in history to get to millions of units
per year as soon as possible. I think, I feel confident in getting to 1 million units per year in less
than five years, maybe four years. So, by 2030, I feel confident in predicting 1 million Optimus
units per year, it might be 2029. So, let's see.
With respect to energy, our energy business is doing very well. The Megapack is -- enables utility
companies to output far more total energy than would otherwise be the case. When you think of
the energy capability of the grid, it's much more than -- it's a total energy output per year is -- if
the power plants could operate at peak power for all 24 hours, as opposed to being at half hour,
sometimes a quarter power at night, then you could double the energy output of existing powerplants. But in order to do that, you need to buffer the energy so that you can charge up the --
something like battery pack at night and then discharge into the grid during the day.
So, this is a massive unlock on total energy output of any given grid over the course of a year.
And utility companies are beginning to realize this and are buying our Megapacks at scale. So, at
this point, 1 gigawatt class battery is quite a common thing. So, we have many orders and offer
for gigawatt and beyond batteries. And we expect the energy -- the stationary energy storage
business to scale ultimately to terawatts per year. So very, very good numbers.
Q1 -- first quarters of a year or so, are usually pretty tricky. It's usually the worst quarter of the
year, because people don't want to go buy a car in the middle of winter during the blizzard. And
this -- so, we picked Q1 as a good quarter to do a cut over to the new version of the Model Y, and
we changed production of the world's best-selling car. It's worth remembering that the Model Y is
the best-selling car of any kind on Earth, with a 1.1 million unit per year output of a single model.
And we did this change over at the same time in factories all across the world. So, congratulations
to the Tesla team on an amazing job in pulling off what is a very difficult transition. So, yes, it really
does very impressive work. So, yes.
In conclusion, while there are many near-term headwinds for us in the motor industry, the future
for Tesla is brighter than ever. The value of the company is delivering sustainable abundance with
our affordable AI-powered robots. So, this is outcome. I like this phrase, sustainable abundance
for all. If you say, like, what's the ideal future that you can imagine? That's what you'd want. You'd
want abundance for all in a way that's sustainable, it's good for the environment. Basically, this is
the happy future. If you say, what's the happiest future you can imagine? One which is that would
be a future, where there's sustainable abundance for all. Closest thing to heaven we can get on
Earth, basically.
So, thank you again to the Tesla team for all their efforts at this challenging time. I look forward to
continuing for the team to great success in the future.
`Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much, Elon. Before we move on, Vaibhav has some opening remarks as
well.
`Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
Thanks, Elon. As Elon mentioned, in Q1, we achieved something, which has never been
undertaken in the automotive industry of updating all our factories for the best-selling cars in the
world all at the same time. And this is -- people don't understand, this was not a small feat. We're
not aware of anybody else being able to do the best-selling car all at once within a quarter, and
that, too, hitting all the timelines, which we had established at the beginning. So, a big kudos to
the team for making this happen. Additionally, we also hit a record gross profit for energy storage
business in the quarter.
Now, getting back into the business, there's been a lot of speculation as to the reasons for
decline of our vehicle deliveries in the first quarter. We had previously guided that we will be
updating all factories, and this will lead to several weeks of lost production, which did happen as
well. The ripple effect of the change is not having enough new Model Y available in most markets
for people to see and experience till the last few weeks of the quarter. Additionally, the negative
impact of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards our brand and our people had an impact in
certain markets.Despite this, we were able to sell out legacy Model Y in U.S., China, and a few other markets
within the world. And again, just so people understand, we were producing the legacy Model Y till
middle to end of February, and we switched over and we were able to still sell out within that
period. So again, big achievement by all the people at Tesla to make it happen.
We've been extremely -- we have a very extremely competitive vehicle lineup, which with most
vehicles going through a recent update, and add to that advances in FSD. You have a personal
chauffeur, which can take you almost anywhere under supervision. And numerous stories shared
by customers ranging from how it has improved their daily commute to providing mobility to
customers with disabilities, to giving older customers the ability to travel comfortably and
independently. Not only is FSD supervised safer than a human driver, but it is also improving the
lives of individuals, who experience it. And again, this is something you have to experience, and
anybody, who has experience, just knows it. And we've been doing a lot lately to try and get
those stories out, at least on X, so that people can see how other people have benefited from
this.
Now coming into some of the financial stuff; auto margins declined sequentially, primarily due to
the reduction in the total number of deliveries, lower fixed cost absorption due to factory
changeovers, and lower regulatory credit revenues, offset by a slight increase in pricing due to
the launch of new Model Y despite incentives, which we had to sell legacy Model Y.
Our energy storage business, like I said before, has achieved yet another milestone of great --
highest gross profit in the quarter. This was despite sequential decline in demands. The
importance of this business, as Elon mentioned, is pretty profound, especially in this environment,
because if in order for grids to work properly with the demands from AI and all this, you need
some more stability. And this is by far the simplest and best solution, which we are aware of,
which can help do this. And we've also developed certain unique solutions to help our customers
to achieve this. Additionally, on the Powerwall side, we've been selling the new Powerwall 3, and
it's been received with very good reception from customers and to the extent that we are
currently supply-constrained.
On services and other margins, they were slightly down sequentially, primarily because of the
pressure on our used car business and insurance business. Note that we continued our journey to
improve profitability in our services and collision business through better labor productivity. As
previously discussed, our operating expenses continue to increase sequentially, primarily due to
our AI-related initiatives, including Optimus, and also cost of development for our vehicle
programs, including Cybercab, Semi, and cheaper models.
These expenses flow through R&D. We believe, even in the current environment, it is the right
strategy in making investments in these areas to position us for the long term. These increases
were offset by decreases in SG&A from changes in our vehicle effort program. Other income
reduced significantly on a sequential basis. The primary reason was Bitcoin mark-to-market loss in
Q1 versus gain in Q4, resulting in a $472 million drop. The remainder of the change is because of
FX remeasurement. With the adoption of the new mark-to-market standard for Bitcoin, we
expect increased volatility in our other income in addition to the FX equivalent.
I know tarriffs is the hottest topic, which people talk about, and it has various impacts to our
business. As Elon mentioned, on the vehicle business, we've been on this journey of
regionalization for years. Specifically in the U.S., Model Y has been rated the most American-
made car on Cars.com in the leading America index three years in a row. This is part of all the
work which the team has been doing over the years. And to the extent that today, if you look atour vehicle lineup in the U.S., we're about approximately, on a weighted average basis, 85%
USMCA compliant.
So, like Elon said, this definitely gives us a bigger edge as compared to our other OEMs in terms
of managing the tariffs. But we're not immune, because when the Section 232 auto tariffs
become effective in May, which includes Canada and Mexico, and Canada and Mexico have been
part of our regionalization study, they will have an impact on profitability. And I know research
modeling on this impact has been up about a couple of thousand, which is pretty much in line with
what we've been forecasting.
The impact of tariffs on the energy business will be outsized since we source LFP battery cells
from China. We are in the process of commissioning equipment for the local manufacturing of
LFP battery cells in the U.S. However, the equipment, which we have can only service a fraction of
our total installed capacity at later. We've also been working on securing additional supply chain
from non-China-based suppliers, but it will take time. Also note that, irrespective of all the impact
on U.S. from our energy -- from tariffs on the energy business, we do have a Megafactory China,
which just started operations in Q1, and that should take care of our business outside of the U.S.
There's also an important impact of tariffs on our capital investments. I know this is going to
sound counterintuitive since in order to launch manufacturing or expand lines, we have to bring
equipment from outside the U.S., because there is not that much capacity in the U.S. and the
current trade environment, such equipment being brought in is subject to --
`Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
The expense of bringing it in from China right now.
`Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
Exactly. And the reality is that China has the basic one, which has the most capacity to provide this
equipment.
Our CapEx guidance, inclusive of modern tariffs, even at the optimization we have tried to do, it
is forecasted to be still in excess of $10 billion this year, and we're still evaluating what more to do
on this side. To summarize, we have near-term challenges in our business due to tariffs and bad
image. We think our strategy of providing the best product at a competitive price is going to be a
winner, and this is the reason we're still focused on bringing cheaper models to market soon. The
start of production is still planned for June.
Additionally, the advancement in FSD-related features, including pilot Robotaxi launch in Austin
later this year, should help create a new era of demand. I would like to thank everyone at Tesla
and our customers.
Questions And Answers
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
(Question And Answer)
Fantastic. Thank you very much, Vaibhav. Now we will move on to investor questions. We will start
with questions from say.com. First question is, what are the highest risk items on the critical path
to Robotaxi launch and scaling?
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `It is Ashok?
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Yes, we've got Ashok online.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Sure. Well, let's just talk about the disambiguation, the Cybercab from Robotaxi, once again. So,
the -- when will the Teslas -- because the Teslas that will be fully autonomous in June in Austin are
probably model-wise. So, that is currently on track to be able to do paid rides fully autonomously
in Austin in June, and then to be in many other cities in the U.S. by the end of this year. It's difficult
to predict the exact ramp sort of week by week and month by month, except that it will ramp up
very quickly.
So, it's going to be like some, basically, an S-curve, where it's very difficult to predict the
intermediate slope of the S-curve, but you kind of know where the S-curve is going to end up,
which is the vast majority of the Tesla fleet being autonomous. So, that's why I feel confident in
predicting large-scale autonomy around the middle of next year, certainly the second half of next
year, meaning I predict that there will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously, fully
autonomously in the second half of next year. Yes.
It does seem increasingly likely that there will be a localized parameter set, like -- especially for
places that have say, very snowy weather, like, say, if you're in the Northeast or something. Like
there's -- it's kind of like a human. If you -- you could be a very good driver in California, but are
you going to be also a good driver in a blizzard in Manhattan? You're not going to be as good. So,
there is actually some value in -- you can still drive, but your probability of an accident is higher.
So, it's increasingly obvious that there's some value to having a localized set of parameters for
different regions and localities. But this is -- I'll put that in the nice to have category, not -- it's not
the required category. Again, really, the car is just very much like a human. It's digital neural nets
and cameras, and humans operate with biological neural nets and eyes. And so, the same
strengths and weaknesses will be present for a digital neural net and cameras to the biological
neural net and eyes.
Ashok, if you'd like to elaborate on that.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
Yes. And speaking to the location-specific models, we still have a generalized approach, and you
can see that from deployment of FSD supervised in China, where it's just very minimal data that's
China-specific. The models generalize quite well to completely different driving styles. That just
like shows that the AI-based solution that we have is the right one, because if you had gone
down the previous rule-based solutions or like more hard-coded HD map-based solutions, it
would have taken many, many years to get China to work. You can see those in the videos that
people post online themselves.
So, the generalized solution that we are pursuing is the right one that's going to scale well. And
you can think of this like location-specific parameters that Elon alluded to as a mixture of experts.
And if you're sort of familiar with the AI models of Grok and others, they all use this mixture of
experts to sort of like specialize the parameters to specific tasks while still being general. This
makes the model use a limited amount of compute to solve for the diversity of tasks that it has to
solve.In terms of addressing the question that asked for, what are the critical things that we need to
get right, one thing I would like to note is validation. Self-driving is a long-tail problem, where
there can be a lot of edge cases that only happen very, very rarely. Currently, we are driving
around in Austin using our QA fleet, but then it's super hard to get interventions that are critical
for a Robotaxi operation. And so, like you can go many days without getting a single intervention.
So, you can't easily know whether you are improving or regressing in your capacity. And we need
to build out sophisticated simulations, including neural network-based video generation. That's all
happening in the background to make sure that we deliver a safe product and we are able to
measure our safety, even though we can't just exceed by driving around the block or something
like that.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. I mean, in very basic terms, if we're seeing an accident every 10,000 miles, well, then you
have to drive 10,000 miles on average before you get an accident or an intervention. So, it's like,
okay. Now, imagine, I mean, we must be really -- people have to be very worked out by the sheer
number of Teslas doing circles in Austin right now. We're like, well, it's going to look pretty bizarre.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
Yes. Some people are chasing us away.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, there's just always a convoy of Teslas going -- well, just going all over to Austin in circles. But
yes, I just can't emphasize this enough. In order to figure out these long tail things, if it's one in
10,000, that says one in 20,000 miles, or one in 30,000, the average person drives 10,000
miles in a year. So, now try to compress that test cycle into a matter of a few months, it means
you need a lot of cars doing a lot of driving in order to compress that -- to do in a matter of a
month, what would normally take someone a year.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
And I would just also add that, if you haven't looked at those videos coming out of China, people
are really --
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, those videos are amazing.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
Yes, they're putting it to real test. I mean, they're -- take it to dirt roads.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
I'll say that the -- frankly, I think the Chinese consumer might be the most demanding consumer,
and actually, our customers in China are awesome. They have a lot of fun with the cars. I saw one
guy take a Tesla on autonomously on a narrow dirt road --
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
Yes.A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
-- across like a mountain, and I'm like, still a very brave person. And the Tesla is driving along on a
road with no barriers, where if he makes a mistake, he's going to plunge into his doom, but it
worked.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you.
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
And if the question was on Cybercab itself, we're in v-sample validation now.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, yes. We should ask that question too.
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
Yes, we have our first, like, big goals coming at the end of this quarter in Q2, and then in the
coming months, they start to large-scale installation of all-equipment Giga Texas with, you got still
on schedule for production next year.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
Yes, and I just want to also clarify, because I think people don't understand the thing that there's
no new building being built, and where is Cybercab going to be built?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
It's in the Gigafactory.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
It's in Gigafactory.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, yes.
A - `Omead Afshar, VP, Operations & Manufacturing Engineering
It's happening, and people don't know it's happening upstairs and all along the lines while we're
still building the Model Ys and Cybertrucks every day.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
Yes.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, so it's worth noting that the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin is three times the size of the
Pentagon.
A - `Omead Afshar, VP, Operations & Manufacturing EngineeringIncluding the garden.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. Yes, including the Ground Zero Garden. So, I go Pentagon, like, this building used to look big,
but then it won't.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, when will FSD unsupervised be available for
personal use on personally owned cars?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Before the end of this year, not necessarily -- within the U.S. -- like we do want to test -- like we
were -- at Tesla, we're absolutely hardcore about safety. We go to great lengths to make the
safest car in the world and have the lowest accidents per mile, and the fewest lives lost. So, we
want to be very careful, so -- and we want autonomy to be definitively safer than manual driving.
So, it's not enough that it just be as safe, it needs to be meaningfully safer than if a car is
manually driven.
So -- and we want to confirm that there's not something. We just want to be cautious with the
rollout. We don't want to jump in at the deep end with an army. So, with that said, I think we
should be able to have it work in several cities later this year for personal use. So the acid test
being, you should be able to -- can you go to sleep in your car and wake up at your destination?
And I'm confident that will be available in many cities in the U.S. by the end of this year.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, is Tesla still on track for releasing more
affordable models this year? Or will you be focusing on simplified versions to enhance
affordability, similar to the rear-wheel drive Cybertruck?
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
Yes, we're still planning to release models this year. As with all launches, we're working through
the last-minute issues that pop up. We're knocking them down one by one. At this point, I would
say that ramp maybe might be a little slower than we had hoped initially. But there's nothing --
just kind of given that turmoil that exists in the industry right now, but there's nothing that's
blocking us from starting production within the timeline laid out in the opening remarks.
And I will say it's important to emphasize that, as we've said all along, the full utilization of our
factories is the primary goal for these new products. And so, flexibility of what we can do within
the form factor and the design of it is really limited to what we can do on our existing lines rather
than building new ones. But we've been targeting the low-cost ownership. Monthly payment is
the biggest differentiator for our vehicles. And that's why we're focused on bringing these new
models with the big move to lowest price to the market within the constraints I just highlighted.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is does Tesla see Robotaxi as a winner-take-most
market? And as you approach the Austin launch, how do you expect to compare against Waymo's
offering, especially regarding pricing, geofencing, and regulatory flexibility?A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Well, okay. The issue with Waymo's cars is they cost way more money. Room shot. But that is the
issue. Their cars are very expensive, made in low volume. Teslas are, I don't know, probably cost
a quarter or 20% of what a Waymo costs and made in very high volume. So, ironically, like, we're
the ones that made the bet that a pure AI solution with cameras and audio, the car actually will
listen for sirens and that kind of thing, is the right move. And Waymo decided that an expensive
sensor suite is the way to go, even though Google is very good at AI. So, I don't know. And it is
worth noting that Tesla has built an incredible AI software team and AI hardware chip design
team from scratch, from nothing. Didn't require anyone. They just built it.
So, yes, it's really -- I mean, I don't see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at present. I'm
sure that'll change eventually. But at least as far as I'm aware, Tesla will have, I don't know, 99%
market share or something ridiculous. That 90-something percent, at least, I don't know, some of
them might change, but if we have millions of cars deployed next year and unless others have
millions of cars deployed -- we'll have -- unless we're blocked by regulatory situations, it won't be
long. I mean, in a few years, we'll have 10 million autonomous cars on the roads and counting.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
I mean, the other thing, which people forget is like, we're not just developing the software
solution, we are also manufacturing the cars.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
And like, what, like Waymo has, they're taking cars and then trying to put --
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Waymo money.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
We don't do that. So that definitely gives us a big leg up. And like Elon said, we already have a big
existing fleet, which hopefully with the software update could become autonomous.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
With the software update, it will become autonomous. To be clear, the Model Ys that we're
talking about in being autonomous in Austin in June are the Model Ys we make currently. There's
no change to it.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
I think people don't appreciate that the car, which they can buy today --
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
The car that they have.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `-- or the car they have is capable of --
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
-- these kind of things.
A - `Omead Afshar, VP, Operations & Manufacturing Engineering
In fact, it does drive autonomously from the factory to the end of line, every car.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
In the U.S.
A - `Omead Afshar, VP, Operations & Manufacturing Engineering
-- the tunnel the Model Y is everything.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Right, yes. Exactly, it is important to use it. It's doing useful work fully autonomously at the
factories. As Ashok was mentioning, the cars drive themselves from end of line to vendors,
where it's supposed to be picked up by a truck to be -- to be taken to the customer. And I'm
confident also that later this year, the first Model Y will drive itself all the way to the customer. So,
from our -- like, from a factory in Austin, and I want in here in Fremont and California, I'm
confident that from both factories, we'll be able to drive directly to a customer to the factory.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Tool delivery.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. Literally goes from the end of line and drives itself to your house.
A - `Omead Afshar, VP, Operations & Manufacturing Engineering
It's important to know in the factories, we don't have dedicated lanes or anything. People are
coming out every day, trucks, delivering supplies, parts, construction for --
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
If only you could film it. By the way, you can see this from the road, like, it's not covered.
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
Exactly.A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
In these videos -- people take videos online and anyone, who wants to go see it and just drive
past our Fremont factory and see the autonomous cars driving themselves. And they drive
themselves and they put themselves in the exact right spot to be picked up.
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
Yes, the logistics yard is right there in the open.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes.
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
We don't move it again to another lane.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
They go to a specific spot.
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
Yes.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, that's just a routine, like, everyday thing now.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, can you please provide an update on the
unboxed method and how that is progressing?
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
Sure. It's progressing, absolutely. As I mentioned just a minute ago, like, it is the basis for our
Cybercab manufacturing process. It's really what we changed in order to allow the low cost of
production and also get the super high levels of automation. Really, levels of automation that are
sort of unheard of in the vehicle manufacturing scale. It's not something that when you see it be
produced, you'll think of in terms of, like, wow, that's how a car has been built for 100 years, it's
really something we've changed.
In the past year, we've been, like, focusing on a lot of key development areas, like marrying these
large sub-assemblies together in a precise way, an accurate way. We've also de-risked things like
corrosion of uncoated aluminum structures, the sealing across the seams of the vehicle. And
when you marry and assemble components, and we've even done early crash testing and proven
that, like, it's going to be just as safe as every other car we've built. And so, like -- as -- with all
that combined, we kind of go into the builds that we have at the end of this quarter for the
Cybercab product, and that's the next real big test of full-scale integration with the unboxed
process. And yes, that's kind of where we are, so you'll see them in testing on the test runs in a
couple of months.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `Yes. Although the line won't be up at this rate --
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
Initially.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
-- initially, this is a revolutionary production system. I'm not sure what the right word is. Unboxing
sounds like something like when you get your phone.
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
And you open it up.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, you have like a pleasant experience when you take your phone out of the box, but -- which
of course, is nice, but this is much more revolutionary than that. This is a profound reimagining of
how to make cars in the first place. No car is made like this anywhere in the world. The factory is
the product as much as the car is the product. So, it's really just the first principles approach to
manufacturing that will ultimately allow us, I think, to -- I'm trying to think -- I'm confident ultimately
it will allow us to achieve a cycle time, meaning a unit every five seconds or less of a single line.
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
And we want to incorporate some of these for testing into our existing production lines as well --
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes.
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
-- Cybertruck already.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
So, this is something I've been thinking about for a long time, and sort of -- I've been thinking
about this for a long time it's kind of -- it's not a crazy thing, like a car every five seconds may
sound like it's coming out like bullets, but actually it's coming out at walking speed.
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
It's like a meter a second.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
A meter a second. So, this is -- like, we're still far away from caring about the aerodynamic drag
of the manufacturing line, because you're still at 3 miles an hour type of thing. Unit every five
seconds sounds crazy, but it's 3 miles an hour that we're talking about. So, yes, you can run away
from it, basically. But that's still by far the fastest line on Earth. I don't know, it's like half our -- half
what it may, that kind of -- what's like the best thing on the line on Earth is like about --
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `Shanghai Phase 2.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
And that's us?
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
33 seconds. Yes.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
We're the fastest, right?
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
I think so.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
We think we're the fastest at 33 seconds in our Shanghai factory, but this would be 6x faster or 7x
faster at best. So, yes, I mean, it'll be slower than that, but the point is that, like, when you fully
optimize the design and operation of the next-generation factory that we're building right now, a
5 second cycle time or less is -- the design is capable of it. So, if you -- like when you go through,
like, a radical new architecture, you go from, like, being, like, an -- I mean, I'd say, like, probably,
China in particular is an A-plus on a moderately -- an advanced, but still --
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
Traditional.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
-- traditional car production system. Sort of, they're really doing about as good as possibly -- as
possible to do in a conventional scenario. So, trying to get much below sort of below, like, 30
seconds is extremely difficult. And you start getting into sort of impossible, where you just have
to be faster than a human could possibly move. So, then the autonomous line, it really just needs
to be robots moving really fast, and that's where you get to some five seconds. So, we'll start off
with getting a C in, sort of an A getting a C in a new architecture. But then the potential is there
over time to move that up to an A-plus within an A-plus architecture.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is how is Tesla positioning itself to flexibly adapt
to global economic risks in the form of tariffs, political biases, et cetera?
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
As Elon said, we've been -- supply chain team have been at it for a while. We continue to mitigate
global economic risks like tariffs and political biases by regionalizing parts supplied near its
factories in North America, Berlin, and Shanghai. For example, in North America, our high-volume
vehicle programs have over 85% North America content, and Shanghai vehicles have over 95%
local content. Berlin has similar levels of regionalization as North America. When you exclude the
battery, and we are working on regionalizing the battery as well. This is a pre-pandemic strategy
that we accelerated post-pandemic through supply diversification, dual sourcing, verticalintegration, advanced analytics, and local partnerships to ensure supply chain resilience and
production stability. Having said that, we are not 100% insulated, and these tariff lists are higher
on our low-volume platforms than the high-volume ones.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. In fact, there's no more vertically integrated car company than Tesla. I mean, we're the most
vertically integrated car company since Henry Ford back in the day when they were doing mining
iron and stuff, and growing rubber trees. So like, we're not growing rubber trees and mining iron
yet, but we have built a lithium refinery in South Texas, and it's I think the biggest lithium refinery
outside of China, I think. Is that right?
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
Yes. I think so.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
But it has -- its output potential would be the biggest lithium refinery outside of China.
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
And we've got space to expand it if we need to build more, right.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
So -- and then we've got the cathode refinery in Austin, next to the Gigafactory. We've got to
figure out what to do about the anode; that's an ongoing subject of discussion. The best of all
possible worlds would be figuring out how to have no anode, the best part being no part. That's
the theme of lithium batteries, to not have an anode. But either way, we better have the anode,
the cathode, and the lithium, and the electrolytes, the separator, to make a cell. But there's no
other car company that has built lithium refineries and cathode refineries. We're ridiculously
vertically integrated, and that's our best position to protect against supply chain disruptions.
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
Yes.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Moravy, do you want to talk about the progress in the project?
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
Yes. Certainly, in our cells, we've multi-sourced every component. We have every part coming
from at least two different countries of origin, which is we started this supply chain team and
engineering team work together on this for the last couple of years to put that together. It's not
something we did in a couple of months. This is years of work. We're in a good position to take
advantage of that. And the insourcing of lithium and cathode, they're the two most critical parts
of the battery. That's right in that backyard, and we're totally insulated from --
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Well, they need to be in operation.A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
They need to be in operation. That's the right --
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
We also make our own cells, by the way. Cell production.
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
Right.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
If you look, there's this -- you make the anode, the cathode, the lithium, the electrolyte separator,
the can, and then you've got to put all that together in the cell factory. And there are entire
companies that all they do is produce cells, but they don't do the other stuff. They don't refine
lithium or the cathode or. So, our cell production is going quite well, and I think we're currently sort
of the lowest cost per kilowatt hour in U.S.
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
Yes, for all the cells we purchase in North America.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, so it's --
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
Lowest cost, yeah.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. So, we have the lowest cost per kilowatt hour, all things considered. So, the Tesla cell is the
most competitive cell, yes, for a kilowatt hour put into a car. If it's a Tesla cell, it's lower cost than
if it's a supplier cell.
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
Yes, and the plan this year is to really build off that base, getting to lowest cost is -- it's the
hardest challenge for a cell manufacturer. It's relatively easy to build a flashy product that does
one thing well. To build something at high volume and low cost, it's super difficult, and we're kind
of using that as a base to then build off and add performance in different areas for new products
coming out.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, so --
A - `Karn Budhiraj, Vice President of Supply Chain
Yes, to Elon's point, there's a lot of advantages for regionalization. The most important thing is
we're not trying to working capital for six to eight weeks on the ocean. If there's a design change,
then everything that's in transit basically has to be scrapped. Secondly, port disruptions, as wesaw during COVID, can be very expensive, because slight disconnects can shut down production.
So, then your only option is costly air expedite. It also gives us resilience and supply chain. If one
region is down, we can bridge with others. It's more work to set up in the beginning, but it's
critical to have when the need arises.
Having said that, it's unrealistic to assume 100% regionalization across the board for specialized
areas such as semiconductors. In such cases, our team works very closely with our partners to
ensure we have strategic banks in place and a disruption doesn't impact production while we
stand up the regional manufacturing for that particular commodity.
A - `Bonne Eggleston, Senior Director, Tesla 4680
And I'll say, like on the rest of the vehicle, like Elon was talking about with cells, we're also heavily
vertically integrated, import ingots, internally cast things, we recycle those and melt some. It's the
same thing with plastics, but it doesn't mean we're not exposed. We do have some areas, where
we use rare earth magnets and we've been working for years to find alternate sources and bring
those up as well as we have our induction machines. And as we've mentioned in the past, we're
working on ferrite lovers for some time. So like, as Karn said, with our heavy regionalization
advantages, we're definitely like the lowest exposed to this, but we're not completely immune,
as Vaibhav mentioned in his opening remarks.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Is it similarly related on the battery die? Is Tesla still battery supply constraint as noted on
the Q4 call? And does that change tariffs?
A - `Karn Budhiraj, Vice President of Supply Chain
So, this is Karn. We've been working very hard to expand battery cell production in the U.S., both
with vendors and what Bonne mentioned earlier with the 4680 program. And we're also working
on moving the upstream supply chain for battery cells in the United States for several years. And
that strategy is really starting to pay off now. As it stands right now, we're not constrained on
battery cells for vehicles. The recent tariffs do pose some challenges to Tesla Energy, like our
CFO mentioned earlier, but it's something we've been anticipating and we should be able to
resolve in a timely fashion.
We actually have a plan in place and we're executing towards it. We also have some other
sources coming online to supplement the shortfall. And then, of course, we have the LFP
production that's happening in-house. We have a slight disconnect of aligning the right cells with
the right packs. So, that's the little bit of puzzle that we have to solve internally, but as far as cells
go, there's no shortage.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, did Tesla experience any meaningful changes
in order inflow rate in Q1 relating to all the rumors of brand damage?
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
So, in Q1, as mentioned earlier, we took the best-selling car of the last two years and ramped up
all four of our global factories. And in less than eight weeks, we've already gone to the rate of
our previous Model Ys in the factories. So, just kudos again to the team for the great job there.
And despite the economic strain and negative articles in California in Q1, Tesla remained theas well. So, interest remains high. And so, right now, we continue to see good interest still in the
vehicle.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. I mean, Tesla is not immune to sort of the macro demand for cars. So, when there is
economic uncertainty, people generally want to pause on buying -- doing a major capital
purchase like a car. But as far as absence macro issues, we don't see any reduction in demand.
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
Correct. And that's where we continue to focus on affordability. And it's fundamental to focus
there.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Fantastic. Thank you, guys. The next question is, regarding the Tesla Optimus pilot line, could you
confirm if it is currently operational? If so, what is the current production rate of Optimus bots per
week? Additionally, how might the recent tariffs impact the scalability of this production line
moving forward?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
The Optimus, the -- I want to sort of emphasize, Optimus is still very much a development
program. It's not a large volume production. That's fine. This year, we'll make a few -- we do
expect to make thousands of Optimus robots, but most of that production is going to be at the
end of the year. So, almost everything in Optimus is new. There's not like an existing supply chain
for the motors, gearboxes, electronics, actuators, really anything in the, almost anything in the
Optimus, apart from the AI for Tesla, the Tesla AI computer, which is the same as the one in the
car.
So, when you have a new complex manufactured product, it'll move as fast as the slowest and
least lucky component in the entire thing. And as a first-order approximation, there's like 10,000
unique things. So that's why anyone, who tells you they can predict with precision, the production
ramp of the truly new product is -- doesn't know what they're talking about. It is literally
impossible. So, you go through this like series of constraints, where it's like, this part is the limiting
factor, now that part is the limiting factor, now this part is the limiting factor, and multiply that by
1,000, basically. And then the rate of the production ramp is decided by how quickly you can
solve each of those problems.
Now, Optimus was affected by the magnet issue from China, because the Optimus actuators in
the arm do use permanent magnets. Now, Tesla as a whole does not need to use permanent
magnets, but when something is volume constrained, like an arm of the robot, then you want to
try to make the motors as small as possible. And then -- so, we did design in permanent magnets
for those motors, and those were affected by the supply chain, by basically China requiring
export license to send out any rare earth magnets.
So, we're working through that with China. Hopefully, we'll get a license to use the rare earth
magnets. China wants some assurances that these are not used for military purposes, which
obviously they're not. They're just going into a humanoid robot. So, it's not a weapon system. Butthat is an example of a challenge there. But I'm confident we'll overcome these issues, and we'll,
by the end of this year, have thousands of Optimus robots.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you very much. And the last question we already covered earlier, whether Robotaxi
was still on track for this year. So, with that, we can move on to analyst questions. The first
question is going to come from Pierre at New Street. Pierre, please unmute yourself.
Q - `Pierre Ferragu, New Street Research `
Hey, guys. Can you hear me?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes.
Q - `Pierre Ferragu, New Street Research `
That's great. So, I'm super excited to hear Robotaxi and Optimus becoming the very tangible
future for Tesla. But I have actually a question on the legacy -- not the legacy, but the current auto
business. And when I look back at the ramp of Model 3 a few years ago, I really saw it as being
the iPhone of cars, a completely reinvented, very different user experience, vastly superior,
impossible to match for traditional competitors. And for the iPhone, it resulted in the high end of
the smartphone market quadrupling in size and actually Apple taking 60% market share.
And so, when you look at the Model 3 and the Model Y today, I think they are still like really vastly
superior to any other cars. And I wonder why they've taken about 15% of the addressable market
and not more actually. So, another way to put it is why are there so many people still buying
BMWs and Mercedes knowing that the Model 3 and the Model Ys are out there and available?
And I wonder if you're trying to solve that riddle internally, if you understand why -- what are these
auto buyers, who are not buying a Model 3 or a Model Y missing? And if you have ideas of things
you could do to address that, maybe there is enormous value left on the table there. Yes, that's
what I'm wondering these days.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, the reality is that in the future, most people are not going to buy cars. So, it's kind of what
one could sort of say, look, if you want to continue with your phone metaphor, I mean, you can
remember the days of the flip phones when there was 100 different flip phone designs, and I
would -- the mistake that manufacturers made was to try to make many different variants of a flip
phone, which was a mistake. They should have made the iPhone, so because obviously everyone
is going to want a smartphone. But in the beginning of when the iPhone came out, I was like,
wow, I can't believe these guys are reacting as though this is death, but they didn't, they kept
making variants of flip phones.
Nokia, I think, at one point was the most valuable company in the world or close to it, but they
kept making flip phones. Trying to find another market niche, maybe somebody wants a phone of
a different style, maybe this different color or whatever it is. No, they just want a super intelligent
phone that can do everything, just one. So, I said this many years ago. years ago, in the future, in
the not too distant future, buying a gasoline car that is not autonomous will be like riding a horse
while using a flip phone. Some people still do it, but it's rare.A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you. The next question comes from `Emmanuel Rosner, Wolfe Research at Wolfe. Emmanuel, please
unmute yourself.
Q - `Emmanuel Rosner, Wolfe Research `
Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, Elon, the public version of the FSD software still has a
decent amount of, I guess, intermittent human interventions that are required. So, what's still
required for the software on your end to get to a level, where it doesn't need to be supervised?
And I'm asking that in the context of, obviously, the June launch being in the next couple of
months. What still needs to happen?
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
We are working on number of items to -- yes. I mean we are aware of the interventions that are
happening in the public bills, and that's why we are hardcore burning it down. Really speaking,
some initial launch city helped us focus on like solving all the issues that we'd face here. For
example, like this focus in Austin, we're not like solving all the issues that customers in Boston or
somewhere else might face. And then here, we just have a big list of all the issues, just burn it
down, and that's what the team is working on, along with other sort of like redundancy issues. For
example, if one of the computers goes down, right down the customer fleet, it would like throw
the red hands and ask you to take over, but we don't want that kind of situation. So, you're
solving both like the reliability issues of the autonomy software and also the reliability issues of
the system software together for Austin.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, to really just work through a long tail of unusual interventions. So -- and these are really very
rare. Like, it's a singular intervention every 10,000 miles. I mean, that's a lot of driving you've got
to do to even find one case, where that happens.
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
Yes. And some interventions that happen due to systematic, missing functionality, for example,
for handling emergency vehicles correctly, you don't need to consume audio as an input. But then
the customer-facing versions don't have audio input, but the version that's going to be in Austin
will have audio input and so on.
Q - `Emmanuel Rosner, Wolfe Research `
Okay, but would you have like remote operators, for example?
A - `Ashok Elluswamy, Director, Autopilot Software `
I mean, every now and then, if a car gets stuck or something, someone will, like, unblock it. But it's
just because we are a bit conservative and tend towards more safety than even if we get stuck
now and then, we do have remote support, but it's not going to be required for safe operation. If
anything, it's just required for more availability.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Anyway, it's only a couple months away, so you can just see it for yourself in a couple months in
Austin.A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Our next question comes from Edison at Deutsche Bank. Edison, please unmute yourself.
Q - `Edison Yu, Deutsche Bank `
Hi. Thank you very much for the question. So, I want to ask about the Optimus supply chain going
forward. You mentioned a very fast ramp up. What do you envision that supply chain looking like?
Is it going to require many more suppliers to be in the U.S. now because of the tariffs? How does
one kind of think about what needs to happen there?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
We'll have to see how things settle out. I don't know yet. I mean, some things we're doing -- as
we've already talked about, which is that we've already taken tremendous steps to localize our
supply chain. I think we're more localized than any other manufacturer. And we have things
underway to increase the localization, to reduce supply chain risk associated with geopolitical
uncertainty.
Did you have a follow-up, Edison?
Q - `Edison Yu, Deutsche Bank `
Yes. Wanted to come back actually to the Robotaxi then. Do you have a sense on how many cars
or how big the scale will be initially and how that might ramp up? I know you're targeting millions
of vehicles in the second half kind of next year. But initially at launch, how many vehicles would be
reasonable? And is it going to be as simple as if one goes to Austin, let's say, in late June or July,
you'd be able to request?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. We're still debating the exact number to start off on day one, but it's like, I don't know,
maybe 10 or 20 vehicles on day one. And watch it carefully. They scale it up rapidly after that. So,
we want to make sure that we're paying very close attention the first time this happens. But yes,
you'll be able to end of June or July, just go to Austin and order a Tesla autonomous drive.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. The next question comes from George at Canaccord.
Q - `George Gianarikas, Canaccord Genuity `
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. It has to do with FSD pricing. Can we envision when you
launch unsupervised FSD that there could be sort of a multi-tiered pricing approach to
unsupervised versus supervised, similar to what you did with autopilot versus FSD in the past?
Thank you.
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
I mean, this is something, which we've been thinking about. I mean, just so you know, for people,
who have been trying FSD and who've been using FSD, they think even the current pricing is too
cheap because for $99, you're basically getting a personal chauffer.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `Yes. I mean, we do need to give people more time to if they want to look at -- like a key break
point is, can you read your text messages or not?
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
Yes.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Can you write a text message or not? Because obviously people are doing this, by the way, with
non-autonomous cars all the time. And if you just go for a drive down the highway and you'll see
people texting while driving, doing 80 miles an hour.
A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
And putting their makeup on at the same time.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. Putting on makeup, doing their hair with the mirror down and texting and driving at 80 miles
an hour. This is a common occurrence. So, people eating lunch, you name it, shaving. So, anyway,
but right now, the car is very consistent that you pay attention to the road, so which reduces the
value somewhat, because it's very rigorous about you paying attention to the road. And we'll
gradually lighten up on that with every few weeks or every month. We'll relax that a little bit so
you can be more and more able to do things you want to do and not have the car demand your
attention. So that value, it'll really be profound when you can basically do whatever you want
including sleep, and that $99 is going to seem like the best $99 you've ever spent in your life.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. And George, do you have a follow-up?
Q - `George Gianarikas, Canaccord Genuity `
My follow-up is about geographic expansion. Just maybe discuss additional markets. There's
been some news around India recently that you could launch this year and next? Thank you.
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
So, yes. I mean, we've been working on getting into India. India is a very hot market. And
especially the current -- and I don't want to talk just about tariffs, but the current tariff structure
with India is that any car, which we send in is subject to 70% tariff. Also, like a 30%, luxury tax on it.
So, the same car which we're sending is like 100% more expensive than what it is. So that creates
a lot of anxiety. It's like, people feel, okay, they're paying too much for the car. And by the way,
we're not getting the money. The local government is getting the money. And that's why we've
been very careful trying to figure out when is the right time. We -- like I said, we are working on it.
It's a great -- it would be a great market to enter, because India has a big middle class, which we
would want to tap in and that is the market, which we want to be in. But again, these kinds of
things create a little bit of tension which we're trying to work around.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you so much. The next question comes from `Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley at Morgan Stanley. Go
ahead, Adam. We can't hear you, Adam. So maybe we'll put you back in the queue and we'llmove to `Colin Langan, Wells Fargo from Wells Fargo while Adam figures out his audio. Colin, please unmute
yourself.
Q - `Colin Langan, Wells Fargo `
Great. Do you hear me?
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Yes.
Q - `Colin Langan, Wells Fargo `
Great. You're still sticking with the vision-only approach. A lot of autonomous people still have a
lot of concerns about sun glare, fog, and dust. Any color on how you anticipate on getting around
those issues, because my understanding, it kind of blinds the camera when you get glare and
stuff.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Actually, it does not blind the camera. We use an approach, which is direct photon count. So,
when you see a processed image, so the image that goes from the sort of photon counter -- the
silicon photon counter, that then goes through a digital signal processor or image signal
processor, that's normally what happens. And then the image that you see looks all washed out,
because if you point the camera at the sun, the post-processing of the photon counting washes
things out. It actually adds noise. So, part of the breakthrough that we made some time ago was
to go with direct photon counting and bypass the image signal processor. And then you can drive
pretty much straight at the sun, and you can also see in what appears to be the blackest of
nights. And then glare and fog, we can see as well as people can, probably better, but I'd say
probably slightly better than people, well, than the average person anyway, and yes.
Q - `Colin Langan, Wells Fargo `
So, the camera is able to see when there's direct glare on it; a little surprised by that.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, yes.
Q - `Colin Langan, Wells Fargo `
Okay. And then just there were obviously media reports the other day that the affordable model
was delayed. Doesn't sound like that's correct. Those reports also talked about it being more of
a cheaper version of the Model Y. Any color on what we should expect? Is it a cheaper version of
the Model Y, or is it actually going to be a design change with it?
A - `Vaibhav Taneja, Chief Financial Officer `
So, I think Lars already covered it in answering one of the Say.com questions. The real thing, which
we are trying to focus on is affordability. And using our existing lines, and there's always
limitations when you're using existing lines as to how many different form factors can you bring to.
So, that's the way I would say you should think about it. And I don't know if Lars anything more to
it.A - `Lars Moravy, Vice President, Vehicle Engineering `
Yes, I think I said this before in other calls, like, with the recent upgrades to the Model 3 and
Model Y platforms, we made some pretty great cars, pretty great prices, and we added a bunch
of features and things like that. I think it's easy to consider that moving forward Tesla doesn't
make bad cars and we always make -- our intent is not to make a car that is any worse than any
car we've ever produced in the past. And so, models that come out the next month will be built
on our lines and will resemble in form and shape the cars we currently make. And the key is that
they'll be affordable, and you'll be able to buy one.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Right, we might have time for one last question. Adam, we'll try your audio again. You want to try
to unmute yourself, Adam? All right, unfortunately, still not working.
Q - `Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley `
Sorry.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
There you go.
Q - `Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley `
Sorry, guys. Technology.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Go ahead, Adam.
Q - `Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley `
Yes, hi. Yes, in the February 28th Joe Rogan interview, Elon, you advocated for a rampant tariffs to
give people time to adjust; otherwise, quote, you said "The system would break and bad things
would happen." So, are things breaking yet? And if the announced as -- if the tariffs as announced
remain in place, when would things start breaking?
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, I'm not -- I'm one of many advisors to the President, I'm
not the President. So -- and but I've made my opinion clear to the President and -- but -- and a lot
of people made their opinion clear to President. He talks to many people and he makes his
decision, and I'm hopeful that President will observe whether my predictions are more accurate
than the predictions of others, and perhaps where my advice differently in the future. We shall
see.
But I'm an advocate of predictable tariff structures, and generally, I'm an advocate for pre-trade
and lower tariffs. Now one does need to take a look at where, if some country is doing something
predatory with tariffs or is providing extreme support for -- if a government is providing extreme
financial support for a particular industry, then you have to do something to counteract that. So --
but I think that that's on a case-by-case basis strategically. But the President is the elected
representative of the people and is fully within his rights to do what he would like to do.Q - `Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley `
Okay, Elon. I respect that. Just as a follow-up, and thanks again, between China and the United
States, who in your opinion is further ahead on the development of physical AI, specifically on
humanoids, and also drones? I'd be interested. And is it even close? And kind of how, yes,
seriously --
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
Well, I think you know the answer on drones. I mean --
Q - `Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley `
Yes.
A - `Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer `
I mean, yes. A friend of mine, Naval, made this -- posted on X. I reposted it. I think a prophetic
statement, which is any country that cannot manufacture its own drones is doomed to be the
vessel state of any country that can. And we can't -- America cannot currently manufacture its own
drones. Let that sink in, unfortunately. So, China, I believe, manufactures about 70% of all drones.
And if you look at the total supply chain, China has almost 100% of drones or have a supply chain
dependency on China. So, China is in a very strong position.
And here in America, we need to shift more of our people and resources to manufacturing,
because this is -- and I have a lot of respect for China, because China is amazing actually. But the
United States does not have such a severe dependency on China for drones and be unable to
make them unless China gives us the parts, which is currently the situation.
With respect to humanoid robots, I don't think there's any company in any country that can match
Tesla. Tesla and SpaceX are number one. So -- and then, I'm a little concerned that on the
leaderboard, ranks 2 through 10 will be Chinese companies. But I'm confident that rank 1 will be
Tesla.
A - `Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations
Great. Well, I think that's unfortunately all the time we have for today. We appreciate all your
questions and look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much and goodbye.
