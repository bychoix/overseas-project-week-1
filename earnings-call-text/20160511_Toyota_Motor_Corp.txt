`Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group. It's my pleasure to discuss
Toyota's financial results for the fiscal year which ended in March 2016.
Let me start with Slide 5. Compared to the previous fiscal year, consolidated vehicle sales
decreased by 291,000 units to 8,681,000 units. Sales increased in North America against a
backdrop of a solid market. However, sales decreased in Japan, where the mini-v group markets
contrasted. In Asia, where competition intensified on the back of a sluggish market. And, in the
Middle East, Africa, and the Central and the South America while weak oil prices and local
currencies affected the demand.Please look up Slide 6. Our consolidated financial results for the fiscal year were net revenues of
¥28,403.1 billion; operating income of ¥2,853.9 billion; pre-tax income of ¥2,983.3 billion; and net
income of ¥2,312.6 billion.
Now, I would like to hand the rest of this presentation to Ms. Morita, our interpreter.
Unverified Participant
Next, using slide seven, I would like to explain the factors, which impacted operating income year
on year. The positive factors such as cost reduction efforts and favorable foreign exchange rates
more than offset the negative factors, such as decreased vehicle sales and increased expenses,
particularly labor cost and R&D expenses. As a result, operating income increased by ¥103.4
billion compared to the previous fiscal year.
Next, I would like to elaborate on operating income for each region by referring to Slide 8. Please
note that in the presentation slide, each region's operating income excludes valuation gains and
losses from interest rate swaps attributed to financial services. In Japan, although net new
models, such as the Sienta and the Prius drove sales, overall vehicle sales decreased by 95,000
units year on year to 2,059,000 units, as the mini-vehicle market was sluggish.
Operating income increased by ¥102.6 billion to ¥1,676.7 billion mainly as a result of cost reduction
efforts and favorable foreign exchange rates in spite of decreased vehicle sales and increased
R&D and depreciation expenses.
Please look at slide nine. In North America, vehicle sales grew by 124,000 units to 2,839,000
units year on year, driven primarily by SUVs, such as the RAV4 and Lexus NX, on the back of a
solid market environment.
Operating income was ¥505.6 billion, down ¥32.2 billion compared to the previous fiscal year.
This is mainly due to increased cost for the relocation of our North American headquarters, and
declined profitability of exports in Canada and Mexico caused by the stronger U.S. dollar, which
more than offset the increased vehicle sales and cost reduction efforts.
In Europe, as shown on slide 10, vehicle sales decreased by 15,000 units year on year to
844,000 units. This was mainly due to decreased sales in Russia, where the market was affected
by weak oil prices and ruble depreciation, despite solid sales in Western Europe. Even with the
negative foreign exchange impact and fewer vehicle sales however, operating income rose year
on year to ¥75.7 billion, primarily due to the effect of marketing activities, such as pricing
improvement and cost reduction efforts.
Please look at slide 11. In Asia, overall vehicle sales were down 144,000 units year on year to
1,345,000 units, particularly due to decreased sales in Thailand and Indonesia, where
competition intensified on the back of sluggish demand. Nevertheless, operating income reached
¥455 billion, up ¥21.4 billion year on year. This is because of the negative impact of decreased
vehicle sales was more than offset by marketing efforts, such as pricing improvement, improved
profitability of exports due to depreciation of the local currencies and cost reduction efforts.
Please move on to slide 12. In other regions, overall vehicle sales were 1,594,000 units, down
161,000 units year on year, as a result of decreased sales in the Middle East, Central and South
America, and Africa, where weak oil prices and local currencies affected the markets. Operating
income decreased by ¥6 billion year on year to ¥103.4 billion, despite the positive impact of
pricing improvement and the full model change of the IMV series, mainly as a result ofdeteriorated import profitability, due to weaker local currencies and rising labor costs with
inflation in Central America and South America.
Next, please take a look at slide 13 for financial services. Operating income excluding swap
valuation gains and losses for the fiscal year maintained the level of the previous fiscal year at
¥319.0 billion. This was a result of growth in both lending balance and margins, which offset an
increase in costs related to loan losses and residual-value losses.
Please refer to slide number 14. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies for the fiscal year was
¥329.0 billion, up ¥20.5 billion year on year. This was a result of strong performance of our
affiliated companies in China.
Next, please look at Slide 15 on shareholder return. Earlier today, our board of directors resolved
to pay ¥110 per share as the year-end dividend on common shares. The full year dividend on
common shares for the fiscal year will be ¥210 per share, including the interim dividend of ¥100
per share. This represents an increase by ¥10 per share, compared to the previous fiscal year.
This is based on our policy of paying stable and sustainable dividends targeting at a consolidated
payout ratio of 30%.
Next, please look at the Slide 16. Also today, our board of directors resolved a plan to buy back
up to ¥500 billion, or 100 million shares of our common stock. Adding this to the already
repurchased common stock in the amount of ¥139.3 billion, following the resolution at the second
quarter financial reporting, our total share repurchase for the fiscal year through March 2016will
be up to ¥639.3 billion or 123 million shares.
This based on both our intention to improve capital efficiency and our capital policy, which is
responsive to ongoing financial conditions and changes in the business environment, marks a
higher level of shareholder return than before. Please note that when discussing share
repurchase for a fiscal year, we refer to the total amount of shares actually repurchased or
authorized to be repurchased by our board as a means of shareholder return during and at the
end of that particular fiscal year.
Please look at the chart on slide 17, which indicates the total shareholder return over the recent
years, consisting of both dividends on common shares and Model AA Class shares and share
repurchase. The total shareholder return for the fiscal year through March 2016 will be up to
¥1.2872 trillion, representing a payout ratio of up to 55.6%. In appreciation of our long-term
relationship of trust with our shareholders, we will continue to ensure stable, sustainable, and
flexible shareholder return.
Now I would like to move on to discuss the outlook for the current fiscal year, which will end in
March 2017, by referring to slide 18 and beyond. Following the Kumamoto earthquake, we
suspended all vehicle assembly lines in Japan in stages. We regret that this may have caused
inconvenience and concern to our customers and all other stakeholders. Since April 25, we have
restarted these lines in stages and are back to normal operations. We are now making maximum
effort to deliver vehicles to our customers as soon as possible. However, please note that the
impact of the suspended operations is not factored in our forecast due to difficulties in
estimation at this point in time. We appreciate your understanding.
So at this juncture, please refer to slide 19. Our consolidated vehicle sales are expected to
increase by 219,000 units year on year to 8.9 million units. We anticipate sales growth in Japan,
driven by C-HR and other new models on top of the recently launched Prius and Passo in Asia due
to a full scale marketing of the IMV series and in Western Europe due to continued strength ofPlease move on to the next slide, slide 20 that is. Based on the foreign exchange rate
assumption of ¥105 per U.S. dollar and ¥120 per euro, our forecast of consolidated financial
performance for the fiscal year through March 2017 are net revenues of ¥26.500 trillion,
operating income of ¥1.700 trillion, pre-tax income of ¥1.900 trillion, and net income of ¥1.500
trillion.
Now, please look at the slide 21 for the analysis of our operating income forecast for the current
fiscal year in comparison to the previous year. The negative impact of foreign exchange rates is
the most significant cause for the expected decrease in operating income year on year. While
continuing cost reduction and other profit improvement activities as well as benefiting from
increased vehicle sales, we also assume an increase in expenses. As a result, we expect a decline
in operating income by about ¥1.1 trillion.
Finally, please look at slide 22 for the outlook for R&D expenses, capital expenditures, and
depreciation expenses. CapEx is expected to increase by ¥57.5 billion compared to the previous
fiscal year due to investments for production facilities for new TNGA models as well as the full
impact of building new North American headquarters. R&D expenses are also expected to
increase year on year as development of advanced and cutting-edge technologies accelerates.
We are determined to continue our investments for the future regardless of external factors such
as foreign exchange rates. At the same time, we aim to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of
our investments and further improve our prospective earnings going forward.
This concludes our presentation on the financial results for the fiscal year through March 2016.
Thank you for your attention.
`Masayoshi Hachisuka, Project General Manager, Accounting Division
Thank you. Now we are glad to take your questions, but only up to two questions per person,
please. Further questions may be possible later if time allows. You don't have to name yourself.
Our conference call operator will explain how to connect your lines.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Hachisuka.
Thank you, sir, for the question and for the roundup. I wondered if we could start with the fixed
cost increases that you're looking for next year, which is ¥540 billion. I wonder if you could
perhaps give us a bit more details on that. Actually it's quite a high figure and perhaps in
particular the number that you have for the expenses, et cetera, which is ¥300 billion. Could you
perhaps give us some more details on that? And, if you could remark on whether there's any
recall costs included in that number please?
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
Thank you very much for your question. There has been increase by expected – there is an
expectation for increase of ¥300 billion or so relating to expenses. And let me refer to the
breakdown of that. This includes so-called expenses among others, which causes the decrease
of profit by ¥65 billion and more specifically it includes expenses related to the currently ongoing
preparation for the new plant in Mexico in North America. And at the same time, we are now
preparing for the consolidation of headquarter functions under the tag read One Toyota forNorth America. And furthermore, the inflation is increasing in Central and South America and all
those resulted in increased expenses, depressing the earnings by $65 billion.
And in terms of other factors, there are various items included on the other factors, which all
together reduces the earnings by ¥85 billion. And I just mentioned various factors or items. This
includes some increase in expenses relating to (20:30) in relation to the switch-off of our models
and model changes, and also increase in the business tax liability among others, and altogether
those small various items adds up to ¥85 billion reduction in earnings.
And in relation to that, as another major item, we are expecting increase in quality related
expenses. Compared with the previous fiscal year, we are assuming that there is going to be
rather significant increase in that. The rough image of that is ¥150 billion.
In order to prepare for any potential risks in the future, based upon the past track record of
various items, we are expecting to make additional provisioning in the form of warranty
expenses.
Q - Operator
Okay. And is that specifically related to the Takata bag at all? Was that more of a general
expense?
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
Thank you very much. Our company does refrain from making any specific comments regarding
the specific items or projects. But as included in your question, the Takata issue is also included.
That is to say, based upon the past track record, we book the appropriate amount of a
provisioning for quality related reserves and this – we hear a lot about most recent items and
projects going forward, but those provisioning and reserves as that is going to be established is
in the magnitude that is not likely to negatively impact the expected projected outcome for the
fiscal year concerned.
Q - Operator
Thank you. And just a second question. I wonder if you could just break down the ¥165 billion of
positive contribution from volume and model mix a bit more for us please.
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
First of all, in terms of the increase in volume, as I mentioned earlier, we are expecting or we are
planning to increase the consolidated sales volume by 219,000 units, which means increase in
earnings by ¥155 billion.
In terms of the impact stemming from model mix in general, we're expecting a positive impact of
¥10 billion and the major reason behind that, especially improvement in model mix, relates to the
expected increase in IMV series vehicles as well as RS among others. But at the same time, there
are some factors causing a deterioration of the model mix, that is to say the expected decrease
in sales volume of the Middle East. And so netting out both of those factors, the net outcome is
expected ¥10 billion improvement stemming from model mix.
Q - Operator
Thank you very much.A - `Masayoshi Hachisuka, Project General Manager, Accounting Division
Next please.
Q - Operator
Yes, thank you from me. So I have two questions. The first is relating to North America and if you
could just explain a bit more about the increased costs from the relocation of the headquarters in
the U.S. How much that affected last year's earnings in the U.S. and how much you're expecting it
to affect this year's earnings? And then secondly, just in terms of the currency breakdown, maybe
a bit more detail on the others in currency, which currency has been the biggest effects from that,
is it being the ruble or is it equal across many currencies? Thank you.
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
Let me start with expenses and my answer is based upon the units of millions. Compared with
the fiscal year that ended in March 2015 and the fiscal year just ended, there has been increase in
expenses by ¥70 million. And for the next – the fiscal year just started, we are expecting an
increase in expenses of ¥120 million.
About your second question, that is the impact of the currencies included in other currencies and
my answer may become a bit longer. But I would like to refer to impact stemming from different
currencies that is included in the foreign exchange fluctuation impact as a part of the projection
that we shared with you.
As was already mentioned in the presentation, in relation to the U.S. dollar, ¥630 billion is the
negative influence of the impact and in relation to euro that we will subtract from the earnings by
¥50 billion.
Furthermore, we are expecting some traction from the earnings by ¥35 billion stemming from
Australian dollar, Canadian dollar ¥10 billion, Great Britain pound sterling is ¥15 billion and Russian
ruble ¥55.0 billion. And those are also all expected to have a negative impact.
In terms of the relationship between the emerging market countries and the key currencies, we
are expecting around ¥20 billion impact stemming each from Brazilian real, South African rand,
and Thai baht, so ¥20 billion each from those currencies.
Furthermore, renminbi, Argentina peso, the rupee, Indonesian rupiah, and in relationship of the
Canadian dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, or Australian dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, we are
expecting ¥10 billion or so impact each from those currencies in the negative direction. So the
impacts that I have just mentioned in relation to each of those currencies are included in the
assumptions that we mentioned for the current remaining fiscal year, and all will have a negative
effect.
Q - Operator
Okay, thank you. And sorry, can I just confirm in terms of the headquarter cost, so I think you were
saying I presume it's ¥70 billion of cost and increased to ¥120 billion of cost. I think you said
billion...
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
The unit is in million and those are in U.S. dollars. Million U.S. dollars.Q - Operator
It's U.S. $70 million and it will cost – and it will be U.S. $120 million. Okay.
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
U.S. $120 million.
Q - Operator
Thank you.
Thank you. Next please.
...items is for dividends and buybacks for this fiscal year please, fiscal year ending March 2017?
Could you repeat the question again, please?
Yes, so your guidance for dividends and share buybacks for this fiscal year ending March 2017,
please.
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
We have never disclosed our plan for dividend payment or share repurchase program. And
nothing has been decided with respect to the dividend or the shareholder return for the fiscal
year ending in March 2017. And those will be determined based upon the comprehensive
examination in consideration of performance of the fiscal year concerned, the investment
planned, and also cash on hand. And at the same time, we will take into very serious
consideration the long-term relationship based upon trust with the shareholders, and we make
every effort to maintain that very good relationship. And nothing in the policy has been changed
over the years.
Q - Operator
Thank you.
A - `Masayoshi Hachisuka, Project General Manager, Accounting Division
Thank you. Next please.
Q - Operator
Two questions please. Firstly, on the automobile business balance sheet, in the last financial year
there was a big increase in the prepaid expenses line. Could you explain what that was because it
could obviously be – since the padding of profitability. And then the second question, in your
Financial Services cash flow statement, there is also quite a big increase in the depreciation
charge for the last financial year. Again, is that due to more conservative valuations, or is that due
to a deterioration in some stock? Thank you.
The translator, I was not referring to equities when I was talking about the stock. It has nothing to
do with kabushiki.
Oh, is that the inventory?Yes, there was an increase in depreciation charge within the Financial Services cash flow. That's
not referring to equities because you talked about kabushiki.
Sure. Sorry, sorry.
I just want to know why there was depreciation increase there.
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
Let me answer the second question first. This increase in depreciation charge in financial services
stem from the increase in so-called leasing and this is not relating to a write-down or changing
the value of the stock at all.
Q - Operator
Yes. But, I think the growth – my point is the growth in depreciation is faster than the growth in the
leasing exposure. I think that's correct. So, I just wondered whether you're being more
conservative in your depreciation policy there.
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
I would like you to understand that this stems from the increasing volume of our leasing business.
Q - Operator
Okay. And the first question?
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
And I would like to seek your understanding because I would like to look into this matter relating
to the increase in prepaid expenses in the automotive business balance sheet. I would look into
that and would like to get back to you separately and I do hope you understand this.
Q - Operator
Okay. Can I maybe just ask a simpler one then? On electric vehicles, Tesla has obviously had
major success with the mass market Model 3 introduction. Has there been any change in Toyota's
thinking towards electric vehicles compared to hybrids or the hydrogen models?
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
In terms of our thinking regarding electric vehicles, we do believe that electric vehicles are very
useful in terms of a zero-emission vehicle, but at the same time, it still has various challenges that
need to be resolved, including short cruising distance, the long time required for recharging and
also the deterioration of the performance of the battery.
However, as has already been explained earlier for the usage for short distance, or usage as the
second vehicle or usages in fleet, I think electric vehicles do have a good possibility and potential
and therefore we're not relaxing our efforts at all in developing pure electric vehicles.
Q - Operator
Okay, thank you very much.
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `Thank you very much.
A - `Masayoshi Hachisuka, Project General Manager, Accounting Division
Thank you. Next please.
Q - Operator
Yes, good evening. Thank you very much for the call. Two questions, if I may. First of all, capital
spending plans in Japan and the U.S. looked to be rising quite sharply, 17% increase for Japan,
37% increase for the U.S., and I was wondering if you can give us a bit more detail on what the
capital spending will be dedicated to in Japan and in U.S.?
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
Right. In Japan, currently, various activities relating to the switching over to CNG models are going
on, and investments are made for that purpose. And secondly, Hino Motors is now constructing a
new plant in the place called Kobe, and that requires significant amount of investment in plant
and equipment. So, these two topics in Japan caused an increase in CapEx in Japan.
And in North America, as I explained to in relation to expenses, in general, we are now working
under the catch word North America One Toyota, and that also includes various investments in
plant and equipment and therefore the CapEx has increased, is going to increase starting in this
fiscal year and beyond as well.
Q - Operator
Great. Thank you. And the second question is, in your volume projections you were expecting
8.8% growth in volume in Japan. Could you give us a bit more detail as to how you expect to
achieve that? And, if you could include in the answer your forecast for overall demand in Japan in
the March 2017 fiscal year and any particular new models that you think are going to make a
significant contribution?
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
This projected increase in volume in Japan includes the expected increase in consumption tax
rate in April next year, so that's part of the assumption. And, in Japan, at the end of last year, we
introduced Prius, and into this current year, we introduced a new model Passo and is going to
introduce the C-HR. So, with those new model changes, or introduction of new models, we are
planning to increase the volume by 181,000 units for this currently running fiscal year.
Q - Operator
And could you give us your projection for the overall market, please?
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
You're talking about Japanese market or global market?
Q - Operator
Actually, if you could give both, I'd appreciate it but the question is particularly towards Japan.
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `We do not make public the outlook for global market, but we are somehow expecting over
medium and long-term for the global automotive market to grow at the rate of 1% to 2% per
year. With respect to the Japanese market, on the calendar year basis we are expecting the
market, both excluding mini vehicles and also including mini vehicles, to remain more or less on
par with the previous fiscal year.
Q - Operator
Thank you very much.
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
Thank you. Next please.
Q - Operator
Yes, thank you. I have two questions. The first one is on your cash balance. I noticed last year,
looking at your total operating cash flow minus investment in tangible fixed assets, the free cash
flow was around ¥3.2 trillion. What was your net automotive cash and securities balance at the
end of the year? That's my first question.
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
Thank you for your question. As of the end of March 2016, the net cash of our automotive
business totaled ¥7.96 trillion.
Q - Operator
I'm sorry. And just – sorry, go ahead.
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
This corresponds to 3.5 months of the monthly sales revenue, and we have been explaining that
we would like to keep the net cash level, which prepare ourselves to withstand the risks that
could take out six-month equivalents of our operations, both including Automotive business and
Financial Services business. And at the end of March 2016, I believe we have been able to
accumulate the net cash which is close to the level that we have been explaining to you over the
years.
Q - Operator
And just before I ask my second question, what was the increase in the net cash and securities
during the year?
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
Compared with the end of March 2015, the net cash increased by ¥680 billion.
Q - Operator
Okay, thank you. And my second question is, your dividend yield based on the dividend you'll pay
for the year just ended seems to be around 3.7%. In contrast, the average dividend yield in Japan
I think is between 2% and 2.5%, and the yield on Japanese government bonds is basically
negative. I'm wondering if you plan to finance your share purchases with the recycling of financialassets, such as some of your holdings in Japanese government bonds or in lower-yielding
Japanese stock. Thank you.
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
For so-called dividend payment and also share repurchase, our basic stance is to make those
payments out of the earnings made in the fiscal year in question. And the earnings of the fiscal
year in question is used as resources, out of which the dividend is paid and flexible share
repurchase program is implemented. And this is the approach through which we will continue to
return value to shareholders going forward.
Q - Operator
Thank you.
A - `Masayoshi Hachisuka, Project General Manager, Accounting Division
Thank you. Next, please.
Q - Operator
Thank you very much. I think most of the questions have been answered. I did have a question
now about the guidance in Kumamoto earthquake. Number one is, you have restored production,
but are there elements of the supply chain that still feel vulnerable? And number two, I know
things are very uncertain right now, but is it the opinion of the management that there is a
likelihood that the effect will not be felt for the full year results, however it would clearly have an
effect on the first half of the year? Thank you very much.
A - `Tetsuya Otake, Managing Officer & Chief Officer, Accounting Group `
In terms of the impact of the Kumamoto earthquake, that affected the production for the month
of April to the tune of 80,000 units.
And while all the plants are back to normal operation and already the plan and structure is placed
to start the catch up production as well, but since the fiscal year has just begun, we are not quite
sure when and how much volume can be restored. But, we are making every effort so that we'll
be able to minimize the number of vehicles impacted as a result of the accumulated or increase
in production that we're now trying to conduct to catch up with the lost production.
A - `Masayoshi Hachisuka, Project General Manager, Accounting Division
Okay, thank you. Unfortunately, our time is up. So please allow us to conclude today's conference
call now. If you require further information, please contact our IR representatives in New York or
