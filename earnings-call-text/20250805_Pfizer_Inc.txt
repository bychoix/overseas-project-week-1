Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca
DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.
`Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer, Senior Vice President `
Good morning, and welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm `Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer, Senior Vice President, Chief Investor
Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made
available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the
second quarter of 2025 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com.
I'm joined today by Dr.`Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our Chairman and CEO; and `Dave Denton, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, our CFO. Albert
and Dave have some prepared remarks, and we will then open the call for questions. Members
of our leadership team will be available for the Q&A session.
Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements
and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in
our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning, and the disclosures in our SECfilings, which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the
call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and
we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements.
With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.
`Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Our business is
performing well, and I'm pleased with the progress we achieved in the second quarter. We
advanced and strengthened our R&D pipeline. We worked to maximize the value of our
commercial portfolio and made further strides to expand our margins. We continue to be actively
engaged with policymakers as we navigate a complicated and rapidly evolving geopolitical
environment, while also remaining focused on advancing our business.
With our strong year-to-date performance, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for
full-year 2025 and remain committed to our dividend. Our programs to expand margins through
focus, technology, and simplification are working very well. We are driving productivity gains by
leveraging technologies such as AI and automation, and we are also realizing the benefit of
continued streamlining across our company. We believe Pfizer is well positioned to continue
creating meaningful value for patients and our shareholders.
Our top strategic priority this year is, of course, improving R&D productivity. I'm proud of the
outcomes we are driving and the meaningful milestones achieved during the quarter. Looking
ahead, we believe key programs in our R&D portfolio offer significant opportunities to help
address substantial patient need and drive Pfizer's growth in the coming years.
I will mention some highlights. Elrexfio is a medicine that is performing very well with rapid growth
and encouraging progress in claiming leading class share in new markets such as Japan, United
Kingdom, and Spain. The clinical data in Elrexfio, initially heavily treated, triple class exposed
multiple myeloma indication, continue to be encouraging with median overall survival of greater
than two years, which is more than double the historical median overall survival in this population.
Moreover, the majority of responding patients are maintaining their response at 30 months.
Elrexfio has the potential to be a leading standard of care with a differentiated clinical profile. It is
a convenient subcutaneous fixed-dosing regimen, the only one, that now includes a once every
four-week option for select patients. New data presented at the American Society of Clinical
Oncology Annual Meeting in newly diagnosed patients demonstrate the Elrexfio's potential to
move to earlier multiple myeloma treatment settings. These data, from Part 1 of the
MagnetisMM-6 study, show a confirmed response rate greater than 97%, and the manageable
safety profile in combination with daratumumab and lenalidomide.
The randomized portion of this Phase 3 study is now enrolling very well. By executing on
MagnetisMM-6 and Elrexfio's other ongoing Phase 3 trials, we aim to achieve label expansion
that, if approved, would collectively increase the addressable population approximately five-fold
in the growing multiple myeloma market, expected to reach approximately $44 billion by year
2030.
Sigvotatug Vedotin, or SV, is our first-in-class integrin-beta-6 ADC that could be a driver of growth
later this decade. We are executing a robust development program with this investigational
compound in non-small cell lung cancer. This includes our fully enrolled Phase 3 study of SV
monotherapy versus docetaxel in previously treated non-squamous patients that we expect data
from next year.In the second line, plus population, we have observed a durable 31% confirmed response rate,
which is favorable versus historical data with docetaxel monotherapy. We are also enrolling a
Phase 3 study of SV in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in first-line non-small cell lung
cancer with high PD-1 expression based on encouraging Phase 1 data for this combination recently
presented at ASCO.
These results show a 57% response rate and greater than 90% disease control, including
responses in all patients in the tumor proportion score greater than 50% sub, which compares
favorably to historical PD and the PD-1 monotherapy. These results support an ambition to change
standards of care to conventional chemotherapy sparing regimens by leveraging the potential
synergy between Vedotin ADCs and PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. With our ongoing and planned
trials in non-small cell lung cancer, SV has the potential to impact large patient population with a
non-small cell lung cancer market expected to reach over $60 billion by year 2030.
Our strategy is intended to deliver a first approval in previously treated patients before moving
into the first-line setting, which is a non-small cell lung cancer, includes more than 0.5 million
global patients.
In hematology, we continue to promote the differentiated profile of Hympavzi. In the quarter, we
shared positive top-line data from the Phase 3 BASIS study evaluating Hympavzi for adults and
adolescents with hemophilia A or B. The study's cohort of patients with inhibitors met its primary
endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 93% reduction in
annualized bleeding rate compared to on-demand treatment in patients 12 years or older, which
compares favorably to recent approved products for hemophilia A and hemophilia B.
These results further strengthen Hympavzi's differentiated profile as the first once weekly fixed
dose subcutaneous treatment for hemophilia A or B, administered in a convenient prefilled
autoinjector pen. They also support the potential to expand its label to patients with hemophilia
who develop inhibitors to factor replacement as we continue to execute on its launch in the
previously approved non-inhibitor population.
We have seen considerable quarter-over-quarter growth, particularly in the hemophilia B market,
where subcutaneous treatments are only recently available, and follows EU and Japan approvals
at the end of last year, we are seeking reimbursement on pursuing early access pathways in
other international markets as we grow our presence in the hemophilia market projected to reach
nearly $10 billion by year 2030.
Moving to our vaccine portfolio. We are enthusiastic about our potential to deliver the first
approved vaccine for C. difficile infection. Our second-generation investigational vaccine
candidate builds upon encouraging results from the prior Phase 3 CLOVER trial of our first-
generation candidate. This trial demonstrated 100% efficacy against medically-attended C. diff
infection despite not achieving the study's primary end point.
With our second generation C. diff vaccine formulation, we have the potential to simplify the
dosing schedule from three to two weeks. This candidate, now in Phase 2, increased the strength
of the immune response fourfold compared to the first generation vaccine. Based on these
newly announced Phase 2 data, we are preparing for a Phase 3 start before the end of this year.
We will incorporate learnings from the previous CLOVER study to develop new primary end
points, focused on the prevention of severe disease outcomes rather than primary infection. If
approved, the vaccine could significantly reduce the healthcare burden of the nearly 500,000
annual C. diff infections and approximately 30,000 annual deaths in the U.S. alone.In another one of our Phase 3 products, we finished dosing the last patient in our study of a
vaccine candidate for Lyme disease. If successful, we expect to submit for approval next year. We
also continue to strengthen our portfolio by harnessing external innovation through strategic
business development. The recent closing of our global ex-China in licensing agreement with
3SBio grants us exclusive rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize SSGJ-707, a
bispecific antibody. Targeting PD-1 and VEGF has the potential to deliver breakthroughs for
patients in the next wave in PD-1 immunotherapy, which is an established $55 billion market.
With compelling monotherapy data in advanced non-small cell lung cancer presented recently at
ASCO, we view this promising cancer immunotherapy candidate as a seamless fit within Pfizer's
oncology strategy. Given our deep experience in the development of antibody therapeutics and
our differentiated industry-leading portfolio of ADCs, we intend to serve detail later this year for
our plans for a Phase 3 program. With Pfizer's established presence and global reach, we believe
707 has the potential to become a backbone therapy for multiple solid tumor types, where the
PD-1 and VEGF mechanism could have significant impact.
Across our pipeline, we continue to sharpen our focus on programs where the strength of our
capabilities give us the greatest opportunities to address substantial patient need. We look
forward to sharing future updates about our progress.
Now let's move to commercial. Our commercial strategy is unlocking higher productivity and
performance across both our U.S. and international divisions. With several of our established
brands, we are pleased with our continued market leadership and growth.
We delivered another solid quarter for our Vyndaqel family with 21% year-over-year operational
growth. These products are the foundation of care for patients with a serious heart condition or
ATTR-cardiomyopathy, and we continue to see strong progress in diagnosing patients and
providing broad access. While we continue to closely monitor the competitive impact of new
entrants, we believe the Vyndaqel family is differentiated with a strong clinical profile, contributing
to continued volume growth.
With Eliquis, we are the clear leader with robust demand in a growing anticoagulant market. Our
international commercial teams are driving higher growth versus the market in our key countries
with effective engagement with healthcare professionals to reinforce the favorable profile of
these medicines.
In the U.S., the BMS-Pfizer Alliance recently announced a new direct-to-patient option for
purchasing Eliquis via the Alliance's patient resource, Eliquis 360 Support. This option offers
uninsured, underinsured, or self-pay patient an opportunity to significantly lower out-of-pocket
costs for Eliquis.
Among some of our recently launched acquired brands, we are seeing strong underlying demand
in competitive classes as we work to build expanded access and greater awareness and loyalty,
of course, among healthcare professionals. With Nurtec, we continue driving strong commercial
execution. We are pleased with the performance of new consumer campaigns and greater
precision and effectiveness in sharing compelling clinical data with healthcare professionals.
In the U.S., we achieved strong growth in total prescriptions and with 47% market share, maintain
leadership in the oral CGRP class, offset by pressures on net revenues from the impact of the IRA
Medicare Part D redesign and the 340B program.
Internationally, we are achieving strong performance in several key markets where we already
have access and are encouraged by the potential to unlock additional opportunities by continuingto expand access. Padcev, a new -- a key product in our oncology portfolio, is demonstrating
strong performance and we see multiple avenues for future growth. Our ADC for the treatment
of adult patients with locally advanced metastatic urothelial cancer, Padcev achieved high year-
over-year operational growth of 38% in the quarter with growing demand and the one-time
favorable impact from a transition to a wholesaler distribution model for seasoned products.
Padcev, in combination with pembrolizumab, has secured market share greater than 50% in first-
line LA metastatic UC and is the standard-of-care first-line treatment. Additionally, we continue to
anticipate Phase 3 readouts for Padcev in muscle-invasive bladder cancer in two ongoing studies.
If successful and approved, we expect a significant expanded opportunity to treat patients with
bladder cancer focused on the approximately 28,000 in the U.S. with MIBC, approximately 80%
of whom undergo cystectomy.
Cibinqo had strong 46% year-over-year operational growth with a quarter driven by higher
demand in the U.S. and growth in key international markets where we have decided to focus. We
believe there is additional market opportunities for Cibinqo in responding to the need among
patients with atopic dermatitis.
We are seeing the clear impact of recent positive data released for several of our oncology
products. It is contributing to strong growth in helping to establish these products as standards of
care. Lorbrena achieved 48% year-over-year operational growth in the quarter and we expect
continued strength through 2025. It has a compelling efficacy profile supported by the CROWN
study where the median progression-free survival was not reached after five years of follow-up.
Lorbrena is emerging as a standard of care for patients with first-line R-positive metastatic non-
small cell lung cancer.
We saw continued momentum with Braftovi and Mektovi with 23% year-over-year operational
growth in the second quarter. Results from the Phase 3 BREAKWATER trial showed a Braftovi
combination regimen doubled median overall survival versus standard of care for treatment naive
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation. This represents a
significant advancement of the approximately 4,000 patients diagnosed annually in the U.S. with
metastatic colorectal cancer with this mutation. They face a more than twofold greater mortality
risk compared to patients with no known BRAF mutation.
Xtandi contributed strong 14% operational growth during this quarter. Demand is growing for
patients with castration-sensitive prostate cancer, and it is the top prescribed branded androgen
receptor pathway inhibitor. With the presentation at ASCO of long-term overall survival data from
the ARCHES trial, Xtandi is now the first and only androgen receptor pathway inhibitor to
demonstrate an overall survival benefit at five years in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive
prostate cancer.
We also recently served positive top-line results from the Phase 3 EMBARK study, making Xtandi
the first and only androgen receptor inhibitor-based regimen to demonstrate overall survival
benefit in non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with high-risk biochemical
recurrence. This contributed to demand growth for Xtandi, and we achieved 27% share in new-to-
brand prescriptions.
These positive results indicate how we are continuing to invest and focus in areas where we have
leadership and expertise, contributing to ongoing progress with our oncology portfolio. The
strong performance in the U.S. and International divisions show why we remain confident in the
commercial strategy we refined more than a year ago. In the quarter, for example, the key
market and brand combinations we prioritized in our international division are outperforming withstrong mid to high-single-digit growth across all regions. We will continue to advance this
commercial strategy and expect to drive further progress through precision targeting
engagement with patients and healthcare professionals.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave, who will walk through our additional strategic priorities and
progress with expanding margins and optimizing capital allocation. Dave?
`Dave Denton, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President `
Thank you, Albert, and good morning. To begin this morning, let me emphasize that our solid
financial results are a clear reflection of our disciplined execution and strategic priorities. We
remain focused on improving patient outcomes and meeting our financial goals while managing
the complexities of the external environment. Our cost improvement initiatives have contributed
to greater organizational efficiencies as demonstrated by our robust operating margins achieved
this quarter.
Going forward, we expect to improve our cash flow, reduce our debt leverage over time, and
increase flexibility across our three capital allocation pillars. Our focus remains on creating long-
term shareholder value. We will continue to invest in our business for the long-term while
prudently returning capital to our shareholders.
Now, let me start with our second quarter results. Then I'll touch on our capital allocation priorities
and then move to our cost improvement initiatives. I'll finish with a few comments on the macro
environment as well as our 2025 guidance.
For the second quarter 2025, we recorded revenues of $14.7 billion, an increase of 10%
operationally. This increase was largely due to overall growth both in the U.S., and internationally.
Partially offsetting the increase was an $825 million year-over-year unfavorable impact of higher
manufacturer discounts resulting from the IRA Medicare Part D redesign, which took effect in the
first quarter of '25 and overall is largely in line with our expectations.
On the bottom line, second quarter 2025 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.51 and
adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.78, ahead of our expectations, primarily due to strong
top-line performance and our cost management execution.
Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our refined commercial strategy. We remain
committed to prioritizing key products and markets, optimizing the global allocation of our
commercial field resources, and concentrating our marketing efforts on high-priority areas. We
saw strong contributions across our product portfolio, primarily driven by the Vyndaqel family,
Comirnaty, Paxlovid, Padcev, and Eliquis, partially offset by declines in Ibrance.
Also, I'd like to highlight a significant trend within our portfolio that we expect to fuel the
company's top-line for the next several years. Year-to-date, Pfizer's recently launched and
acquired products delivered $4.7 billion in revenue, while growing approximately 15%
operationally versus last year.
We plan to continue to invest behind these two product groups to drive their future performance
and help enable the company to largely offset our LOEs over the next several years.
Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was approximately 76%, primarily reflecting the
product mix within the quarter. Looking at our adjusted gross margin performance over the last
two years, we have largely achieved percentages in the mid-to-upper 70s when adjusting for
Comirnaty, which, as you know, has a 50-50 gross profit split with our partner, BioNTech.In addition, we believe the expected $1.5 billion savings from our Phase 1 of our manufacturing
optimization program by the end of '27 will help bolster gross margins as we transition through
the LOE period. Maintaining a strong emphasis on cost management throughout our
manufacturing network will continue to be a key priority.
Total adjusted operating expenses were $5.8 billion for the second quarter, an 8% decline
operationally versus last year.
Now, looking at the components, adjusted SI&A expenses decreased 8% operationally, primarily
reflecting a decrease in marketing and promotional spend for various products as a result of our
focused investments and ongoing productivity improvements.
Adjusted R&D expenses decreased 9% operationally, driven primarily by a decline in spending
due to pipeline optimization expected to be reinvested later this year and into next year. We
continue to be disciplined with our operational expense management.
Q2 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.51 and our adjusted diluted earnings per share
was $0.78, which benefited from our efficient operating structure in addition to our effective tax
rate, primarily driven by a favorable change in jurisdictional mix of earnings.
Now, let me quickly touch on our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-
term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time,
reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return, and making value-enhancing
share repurchases. In the first half of 2025, we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders via our
quarterly dividend, and we invested $4.7 billion in internal R&D.
As previously mentioned, maintaining our gross leverage at an appropriate level is a key priority
towards improving our capacity for business development. Our gross leverage at the end of the
second quarter was approximately 2.7x, which we are now setting as our new target down from
3.25x. During Q2, we announced the licensing agreement with 3SBio, which closed in July of
2025. Our business development capacity is now approximately $13 billion, following the 3SBio
deal.
Lastly, first half 2025 operating cash flows at $1.8 billion was tempered primarily by large
expected payments in the second quarter, including an approximately $2.1 billion TCJA
repatriation tax payment, and our payment to BioNTech for our gross profit split. We expect to
see improved cash flows in the back half of this year. Overall, we are focused on maintaining
leverage at or below our new target to support a balanced allocation of capital between
reinvestment and direct return to our shareholders.
We continue to be disciplined with our operational expense management, progressing multiple
improvement programs as we remain focused on driving operating margin expansion over the
coming years. We expect to begin realizing initial savings from the Phase 1 manufacturing
optimization program in the latter part of this year. As part of our goal to return to pre-pandemic
operating margin, we remain on track to deliver on our goal of at least $4.5 billion in cumulative
net cost savings from our ongoing cost realignment program by the end of this year.
As a reminder, in total, we expect approximately $7.7 billion in savings by the end of '27 to drive
operating efficiencies, strengthening our business with the potential of contributing significantly to
our bottom line over the period. Of these savings, approximately $500 million identified in R&D
will be reinvested in the pipeline, which we expect by the end of '26.Now with that, let me turn to our full year '25 guidance. The pharmaceutical industry continues to
navigate a complex global landscape influenced by rapidly changing proposed trade and tariff
policies. Strategies to help mitigate the potential impact on our business in the short term have
been implemented. And we continue to evaluate opportunities and develop plans which will help
mitigate the potential long-term impact of tariffs on our business and our operations.
That said, the company's guidance absorbs the impact of the currently imposed tariffs from
China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as potential price changes this year based on the letter
received on July 31 from President Trump.
Our non-COVID revenues continued to perform very well operationally and ahead of our plan. In
addition, our guidance assumes favorability to revenues due to foreign exchange rates. As a
reminder, our plan assumes that a large majority of our COVID revenues are forecasted in both
Q3 and Q4.
Given this fact, we believe it is prudent to maintain our full year revenue outlook as we enter the
second half of the year. We continue to expect full year '25 revenues to be in the range of $61
billion to $64 billion. In addition, we now expect adjusted SI&A to be in the range of $13.1 billion to
$14.1 billion, adjusted R&D to be in the range of $10.4 billion to $11.4 billion, and our adjusted
effective tax rate of approximately 13%.
Now given our strong performance to date as well as our outlook, including a favorable impact on
foreign exchange, our more efficient cost structure, as well as improvements in our adjusted
effective tax rate, we are raising our full year '25 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by
$0.10. This includes absorbing a $0.20 charge for acquired in-process R&D associated with the
upfront payment for the 3SBio transaction.
So just to clarify, without the 3SBio deal, we would have raised our adjusted diluted earnings per
share guidance by $0.30. Of this amount, approximately 2/3 is due to our strong operational
performance and our outlook. I will also point out that while we are raising our adjusted diluted
earnings per share guidance, we are partially derisking the expected COVID performance in the
second half of this year. As a result, our revised full-year '25 adjusted diluted earnings per share
range is now $2.90 to $3.10 a share.
In closing, we will continue to focus on maximizing our product portfolio's value and driving
innovation to strengthen our pipeline. With a stronger balance sheet, we plan to deploy capital
more effectively. We will focus on increasing our R&D productivity by deploying AI and digital
capabilities, reinvest appropriately to accelerate high-value R&D programs, and pursue new
growth opportunities through business development. Additionally, our cost improvement
initiatives are beginning to expand operating margins through productivity gains and streamlined
processes.
And so with that, I thank you for your attention. I will now open it up for Q&A.
`Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Operator, please assemble the queue.
Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from `Trung Huynh, UBS Securities LLC with UBS. Your line is open.
Please go ahead.
Q - `Trung Huynh, UBS Securities LLC `
Hi, guys. Just there in your prepared remarks, you noted your guidance absorbs the potential
price changes this year based on the letter you received from President Trump on July 31. That
talks about impacting Medicaid with MFN. Does that imply you think something's going to happen
this year? And if so, what's your broad assumption so we can kind of quantify that hit on your
revenues and EPS? And then can you perhaps just give us your state of the union on the recent
developments with MFN and tariffs.
And then just on the CDC recommendations for the vaccines, there was a reduced
recommendation in May. The payer pullback for broader adult COVID vaccinations. So just how
are you sizing the '25, '26 U.S. fall season versus last year? And can you comment on any
progress with state mandates or payer negotiations to stabilize that coverage? Thank you.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you, Trung. Let me say I know many people would like to get clarity on the MFN situations,
on the tariff situations. And I'm not in a position to provide much clarity, not because we are not
discussing. Right now, we are in very active discussions. I discussed with the highest levels of this
government. I discussed myself with the President after he sent the letter, me and all the others.
We discussed a lot with the Secretary, Kennedy. We discussed a lot with Dr.(inaudible), who is
responsible for implementing a lot of these things.
And I would say only that these discussions are extremely productive. I think we understand
where the President comes from, and we are engaging in a productive way to find a solution. But
because we are in active discussions, it's inappropriate for me to start providing more details,
because I don't want to say things while we're discussing with them.
So I understand that many others may have questions about that, and I'm not sure I can give
more information than what I just told you that we had a letter that sets a base of what the
President wants. The letter asks a lot from us, but we are engaged in productive discussions with
them. And in general, I'm happy the way that they listen to us and the way that we are trying
collectively to find solutions that from one hand will make medicines affordable in the U.S. On the
other hand, will make our industry even more competitive compared to China, which is
progressing very rapidly to us.
On the tariffs also, I don't have much news to add. We are waiting for the 232 report. And once
we have that, we will see how this discussion -- again, on the tariffs, I had a good discussion with
Secretary Lutnick, with the U.S. Trade Representative, with Secretary Bessent, and of course, with
the President. But we have a special relation through the times, of course.
So that's all I can say. I don't know if, Dave, you want to add something on what is included and
how we think about it.
A - `Dave Denton, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President `
Yes, I just -- I would just say that the underlying strength of our business is allowing us to raise our
guidance in the back half of the year. And with -- to Albert's point, with the work that's going on
across the industry, we're able to come up with a range of scenarios. And we believe that thoserange of scenarios associated with potential timing of all this would allow us to absorb any impact
this year based, again, on the underlying strength of our business today and performance today.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
And maybe, Aamir, you can comment on the CDC.
A - `Aamir Malik, Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President `
Yes. So, Trung, I think your question was largely around Comirnaty. So I'll mention the quarter and
then our expectations for the season. Comirnaty had a very strong quarter in Q2, and I think that's
driven partially by gross to net favorability. We've just become much more efficient and managing
inventory in the marketplace. And we also saw a continued increase in our market share in the
quarter. So that's the quarter.
Now, as it relates to the season, we don't have a crystal ball, but what we are planning for is we
anticipate an indication for the 65 plus population, as well as those under 64 with underlying
medical conditions. And that largely reflects the dynamic of how people vaccinate in the U.S.
today. We also don't anticipate any major changes in coverage by payers for this season. So this
could have a modest effect on our vaccination rates, but we anticipate having a very strong
season.
In addition, I think we're very ready to execute against that. We have our supply and distribution
capabilities, which are genuinely unmatched. We have a very robust plan for both physician, as
well as patient activation and we monitor sentiment very closely. We have not seen dramatic
changes in intent to vaccinate. And we also have very strong contract positions, both in retail and
non-retail. So we look forward to the Comirnaty season for the fall.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you, Aamir. Next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to `Chris Schott, J.P. Morgan with J.P. Morgan.
Q - `Chris Schott, J.P. Morgan `
All right, great. Thanks so much for the questions and congrats on the quarter. Just two for me.
First on BD and capital allocation. Just what's driving this slightly lower target leverage for the
company going forward? I think you lowered it by about a half turn or so. I just was looking for any
color there. And just on the BD approach, is the approach here still to target a couple of smaller
deals with that $10 billion to $15 billion of capacity you've previously talked about? Or is the
thought maybe looking at one larger one?
Last really quick one just to slip in was just the recent PD-1-VEGF deal. I know you're going to think
about doing combos with some of your ADCs. Will we need to see the Phase 3 data from those
ADCs before you move forward? Or should we start to think about Pfizer's starting development
of those programs prior to those readouts? Thank you.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Chris, as usual, excellent question, but David can take the first two, and then I think Chris can talk
about PD-1-VEGF.A - `Dave Denton, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President `
So Chris, yes, we've actually improved our target from a leverage perspective down to 2.7x from
3.25x That's largely because we've improved our cash generation capability over the last -- a little
faster than we anticipated post closing of the Seagen acquisition. So we're now sitting at 2.7x. We
will continue to delever over time. If we were to do a BD transaction, we might tick back up over
that 2.7x, but our objective is to still get down and continue to delever the balance sheet in the
long term.
Secondly, yes, most likely we would attempt to do a, I'll say a smaller deal in the -- given the fact
that our capacity is in the $13 billion zip code at this moment. And so, I would expect there's more
from a smaller perspective from a transaction.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Yes, it is $13 billion.
A - `Dave Denton, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President `
It's $13 billion, only because we have essentially allocated some of 3SBio transaction funds
against our BD target.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you, Dave. And Chris, how do you think about developing the PD-1-VEGF that I know we
closed and we are very rapidly executed on a plan even before we could close.
A - `Chris Boshoff, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Research & Development `
Thank you very much. As you know, we do have ongoing programs with the ADCs, SV, PDL1V and
Padcev, all in Phase 3. We're not going to wait for readout from these studies and we'll start
earlier with Phase 1/2 combinations this year in fact and with those ADCs in combination with
3SBio 707. How we look at 707 is really to be a potential backbone to replace single agent PD-1,
PDL1. It's got a unique structure and the preclinical data suggests potential best-in-class regarding
high affinity for PD-1 inhibition and also -- and potentially increased anti-angiogenic activity.
And you've seen the overall response rate in the first-line setting of 65%. We're confident in this
molecule across the cancer areas or tumor areas that where we have significant capability
including thoracic, GU and GI. And we'll later this year announce the Phase 3 program for 707.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you, Chris. I really -- my team got me very excited about this molecule and they have
presented to me a very aggressive development plan that they plan to execute starting this year.
We will share more news about the plan when we are -- later in the year when we kick off the
execution. Next question, please.

We'll go next to `Alex Hammond, Wolfe Research with Wolfe Research.
Q - `Alex Hammond, Wolfe Research `Thanks for taking our question. I guess one on MFN. Just given your recently announced DTC
patient option for purchasing Eliquis, how should we consider the applicability of this program to
the remainder of your portfolio?
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you, Alexandria. I think this very much will help. I can tell you that the direct-to-consumer
was one of the four things that the letter of President Trump requested from me -- from me and
everybody else. We think it is a fantastic way to go ahead. So we will work collaboratively to do it.
Clearly, Pfizer has good experience from the Pfizer for all where we have a direct-to-consumer
website that has a very, very high traffic. And also now we launched together with our partner
BMS, the Eliquis 360, which exactly does what basically that President Trump is asking us to do.
Actually, I'm sure you've noticed that he tweeted himself. He retweeted, actually, my tweet about
the Eliquis.
And also, we have serious discussions in the industry. So I have connected -- of course, we had
the Board of all the CEOs that we discussed it. And also myself, I'm connecting very often
individually with all the major companies. And they are all ready to roll up their sleeves and
execute something like that. So it remains to be seen. I don't want to speak more, as I said,
because we are in active discussions.
Next question, please.

We'll go next to `Mohit Bansal, Wells Fargo Securities LLC with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Q - `Mohit Bansal, Wells Fargo Securities LLC `
Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Dave, I have a question regarding guidance. It
does seem like you had quite a good quarter this quarter, and there is FX tailwind as well as
operational reasons here. So wondering what is driving the intact guidance, or even like -- not
even like upping it to the high end of the range. But just would love to know your thought process
in setting this guidance at this point. Thank you.
A - `Dave Denton, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President `
Yes. Thank you. I think as we looked at guidance, as I said, we are essentially raising bottom end
by $0.30 and then absorbing the $0.20 charge for 3SBio transaction. At the same time, we are
looking at our future Q3 and Q4, and we're essentially derisking some of that. So this underlying
strength of our business would have us increasing guidance even further from a profit
perspective. But we at this point in time, given the volatility that's potentially ahead of us in
COVID, we think it's prudent to wait, hold, see how Q3 and Q4 come about, and then update as
appropriate from that perspective.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you, Dave. Next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to `Courtney Breen, Bernstein with Bernstein.
Q - `Courtney Breen, Bernstein `Hi, all. Thank you so much for taking the question. A couple from me. The first is on the
efficiencies that we're seeing kind of in your operating model, and particularly around SG&A. It
would be great if you're able to kind of give us some extra context around kind of where you are
kind of reallocating and investing versus where you're able to pull back and as kind of some more
context and details and color around that both within the U.S. and ex U.S.
And then secondarily, you've given us some more details in terms of M&A and the $13 billion
range. But can you give us a little bit more insight on the priorities? I know you've talked about
kind of the obesity opportunity or cardiometabolic opportunity and immunology being areas of
interest. Can you talk about kind of whether they still rank near the top? Or how you're seeing
kind of opportunities out there that you might be interested in? Thanks so much.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
No, thank you, Courtney. Let's start with Alexandre to speak about the efficiency in international
and then Aamir can chime in on the U.S.
A - `Alexandre de Germay, Chief International Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President `
Thanks, Courtney, for the questions. You remember about 18 months ago when we started this
journey at the International division, we said we will pick our growth driver, both from an in-line
standpoint and the a new product. And that combination will be different country-by-country
based on the environment, the potential and the population to treat. That's what we did. So,
we've identified in our top 16 market those combinations and then we invested to win in the
sense that we looked at the share of voice that we needed and then we reduced our investment
everywhere else so that we can win in this area.
And clearly, the growth that we are seeing coming out of that portfolio of assets where we focus
is really remarkable because it's not just that we grew 6% at the international level overall, but it's
also the quality of the growth. You see that we grew 9% in emerging markets, 9% in China, 7% in
Europe. So, it's kind of across the geography and it's also across the different category area,
right? So, specialty grew 9%, driven by Vynda. Primary care grew 4%, 6% excluding COVID, driven
by Eliquis and our vaccines. And our oncology grew 6%, driven by Lorbrena and others. So, clearly,
it's really how we reduce the cost around the non-core asset and the non-key country that help us
double down on the area where we wanted to grow.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you, Alexandre. Aamir?
A - `Aamir Malik, Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President `
Courtney, I'll give you a couple of different examples. When we implemented our new
commercial model at the beginning of last year, we put in place a few fundamentals. One was
having everything in one place and the benefit of scale. So, for instance, we consolidated to a
single agency partner and that drove major efficiencies across the business. Second thing is we
undertook a major resource reallocation exercise, both in terms of the products where we're
investing, as well as the channels that we're investing into.
And thirdly, we've just embraced technology and the way that technology can drive efficiency
across every aspect of our consumer campaigns, our physician targeting. And also, Albert
referred to our use of PfizerForAll and investment in the Pfizer brand, which, for instance, in the
categories where we've deployed that, that model has resulted in about a 20% decrease in thecost per new NBRx. So, these are just examples of how we're driving efficiency across the
commercial business.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
And it is -- I think for me, what really pleased me about it is that we are able to reduce our cost
and at the same time, continue growing the top line, which is the key here. And Pfizer was always
good in commercial.
I do think that we lost a little bit our way during the COVID because the priorities, you can
understand, were 100% devotion of the whole company to do something like that. But I'm very
proud and pleased that we got up to our feet and we now have developed a commercial
machine, but it is really honoring the Pfizer tradition and taking to the next level.
And I will finish with some questions from the M&A. You asked what would be the range in terms
of priorities. And in terms of dollars, Dave talked to you. Clearly, with those dollars, probably will
be in fewer, smaller transactions rather than one transaction or the remaining capital allocation.
Clearly, would be in the four areas that we are now active, which is the oncology, the vaccines,
the internal medicine with cardiometabolic and obesity. And with the I&I on obesity, which is your
specific question, clearly, we have interest in this area because this is an area that is very big,
science is breaking, a lot of new things are coming out. And we have tremendous development
capabilities in the primary care type of business, and we have also tremendous commercial
opportunities.
And by the way, obesity, also there is plenty of offering right now, I mean, in China, China is
booming in terms of how many opportunities we have. Our Chief Strategy Officer, `Andrew Baum, Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, Executive Vice President,
that is responsible for, he just came back from a week-long trip to China, and the opportunities
are really, really very big. So also there are here opportunities in the U.S. So there is a good
substrate that we can choose, but we would be very disciplined with our capital. We will not
overpay. We will pay the real value that the assets deserve.
With that, let's go to the next question.
Operator
We'll go next to Dave Risinger with Leerink.
Q - `David Risinger, Leerink Partners `
Yes. Thanks very much. So Albert, thank you for helping lead discussions with the administration
to ensure the future success of U.S. biopharmaceutical innovation. Since you briefly mentioned
competition from China, has Pfizer been helping the administration understand the very strong
support that the Chinese government provides to local biotech companies based in China? I ask
the question, given significant pressures on biotech companies in the United States. Thank you.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you, David. Also, thank you for your kind words.
I do. And I'm very vocal and I speak at all levels and not only in the administration, but also in the
Senate and the House. This is something that unites, I would say, one of the very few things that
unites both Democrats and the Republicans is their concern about China emerging superiority in
several technological areas, but where it is very impressive is in the biotech. And I very clearly
indicate that this is happening, it's real.I'll give you just some examples. In May, for the first time, Axios reported that the clinical studies
in the world right now, China has the leading share, surpassed the U.S. I did a research myself on
publications that are happening from Chinese scientists right now. And in CRISPR, for example,
just to give one area, 42% of the global publications coming from China. Actually, in structural
biology, which is always was their forte, 62% came from China.
And to end up, they are not doing -- they're not stealing patents. They are -- they have filed more
patents than U.S. this year. And so they are protecting very well intellectual property and they are
enhancing access to their local markets. And they are giving tremendous support, monetary
support to their biotech ecosystem, which encourages a lot of private money going there.
I explained all of that to the administration. And I think they listen. And that's why I said before, we
all look to find ways that from one hand, affordability and access of the American patients, on the
other hand, to the crown jewel, which is the biotech industry, needs to be supported by the
government, by the Congress, so that we can -- there's so much you can do to slow down China.
You won't slow them down. They are very good. What we can do is to focus to be better than
them. And that should be our goal.
With that, next question.
Operator
We'll go next to `Kerry Holford, Berenberg with Berenberg.
Q - `Kerry Holford, Berenberg `
Thank you. A couple of questions for me, please. Firstly, looking at Adcetris, Tukysa, Q2
performance was a little weaker than anticipated. I understand these drugs are perhaps facing
increased competitive pressures, but would be interested to hear your strategy for reinvigorating
that growth of both Seagen assets ex Padcev. And then secondly, a question on the guidance,
specifically tax, and apologies if I missed this earlier, but Dave, what has changed with regard to
the tax outlook for this year? And how sustainable is this underlying 13% tax rate going forward?
Thank you.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Dave, you want to start with that, and then Aamir can --
A - `Dave Denton, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President `
Yes. Just on the tax side, there were some one-time discrete items that allowed us to improve
our tax position this year. I would expect going forward with the new tax regs globally that we
would be largely closer to the 15% level from a global tax perspective in the long-term.
A - `Aamir Malik, Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President `
Kerry, thanks for the question. I think your question is largely around the Seagen portfolio and the
products. So we feel very good about how we integrated those products. As an example, we
were able to cross-train all of our field forces. And now we're seeing the benefit of that come
through in commercial performance. So if I look at Q2 and the entirety of our Seagen commercial
portfolio, we grew 15% year-over-year.
And that was while managing some of the competitive headwinds that you alluded to on
Adcetris, which we are starting to see now settle. In particular, we feel very good about thegrowth in Padcev. We have greater than 50% market share in the first-line and we see headroom
to continue to expand that share, especially in the cisplatin-eligible population where we are very
focused. And it's also important to note that as part of the Seagen transaction, it was not only the
inline products, but the portfolio that came with it, which continues to perform very well.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you, Aamir. Next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to `Evan Seigerman, BMO Capital Markets with BMO Capital Markets.
Q - `Evan Seigerman, BMO Capital Markets `
Thank you so much for taking my question. Kind of a follow-up to the prior question. A year and a
half into the integration of Seagen and really aside from Padcev, what do you believe are the two
or three assets that have the potential to really drive a positive IRR for the $42 billion or so that
you spent? And kind of a follow-up there is what part of the market could SV capture in non-small
cell lung cancer if and when eventually approved? Thank you.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. I will ask Chris to comment. Let's start that there is four main assets that when we acquired
the company, they were around $2 billion, even less of revenues, but they will grow by year 2030
to $10 billion. Now, of course, the value was not only on that. The value was mainly in the platform
of the ADC that we got together with the intellectual property, the capability of the people and
the assets. And I will ask Chris to comment on the most important things that are coming out in
the short-term, medium-term, and long-term prognosis.
A - `Chris Boshoff, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Research & Development `
Thank you very much. So in the short-term, Padcev, and the readouts for the muscle-invasive
bladder cancer studies. And as you recall, the current indication is 18,000 patients. The new
indications will be up to 28,000. So there's both platinum-eligible and platinum-ineligible, and we
expect those readouts in the next six months. And potentially, they could change the standard of
care for this population. This next wave of studies we started, Phase 3 trials in SV, Sigvotatug
Vedotin, the second-line study is now fully recruited. In fact, it recruited much quicker than we
expected.
In the second-line space, what we've seen so far in the Phase 1 study, in a late line population with
a 31% overall response rate, and a medium overall survival, albeit a single-line experience of 16.3
months. So that gives us confidence in SV. It's vedotin payload, so what we've seen with the other
studies with vedotin payloads, including with Tivdak and Padcev, was this potentially synergistic
activity when we combine it with an anti-PD-1. So SV plus pembrolizumab has now been
combined. As you know overall, we've seen a response rate of approximately 60%. But in the
population specifically, that's TPS-high or PD-L1 high expression, all patients so far in the Phase 1
trial have responded. And that obviously is very favorable to what you would expect from
pembrolizumab alone.
The next molecule, PDL1V, that's, again, another first-in-class molecule. We're accelerating that
into a Phase 3 program for head and neck cancer, where we've seen a response rate just shy of
60% in the combination with pembrolizumab. And then there's a whole new group of ADCsof these molecules showing highly encouraging data in Phase 1, and we'll update you in the future
about those.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you. So as I said, we are confident that not only will it recuperate the investment with a
good return in the season, but I think it's transforming our oncology portfolio in business.
Next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to `Carter Gould, Cantor Fitzgerald with Cantor.
Q - `Carter Gould, Cantor Fitzgerald `
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'm going to go back to the policy side. I guess,
Albert, should investors have any expectation around a comprehensive deal that addresses the
President's objectives across MFN and tariffs, but also addresses the industry's concerns around
enforcing IP protection, compounding pill [ph] parity, IRA implementation?
And then separately, Vyndaqel put up a solid quarter year-on-year, but this is sort of the fourth
quarter in a row where sequential growth was more muted or meager. Is Vyndaqel U.S. growth
behind us? And I guess in answering that, can you help frame the push-pulls between price and
competition? Thank you.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. Let me give a brief answer to the policy. Look, I don't know. We are in very active discussions.
You know that the President is impatient, so he wants the results quickly. And we also want to
come to a resolution quickly, because I want to offer certainty to all of us and all of you, as much
as we can have in this period of time. Are we going to -- are we discussing, in addition to all the
things that are related with MFN and tariffs, also things that are related with PBM reform, with
340B, with the pill penalty? Absolutely. And you know that the PBM reform that was -- is
universally accepted, but it needs to happen. There was a bipartisan bill, and there is clear
indication that the President has spoken so many times about the middleman.
Also with the pill penalty, he has spoken about it, and also the Secretary, Kennedy spoke about it,
and also we are working on it. And of course, the 340B has become a major, major problem right
now. The 340B is expected to exceed $62 billion this year. It's a program that has become bigger
than Medicare and Medicaid combined.
So that's all the prices, but all of that is valuable, goes from us out there to, let's say, hospitals,
and this value is not passed to the patients, because they mark up those products in tremendous
amounts, way more than you see in hard data [ph]. And we can't afford that. So we are
discussing, we are explaining, it's more complicated than 340B because it involves hospitals. But
the program is very good for the small hospitals that was intended. This is not about not having
340B, it's about not having an abuse in the system. So, Aamir, you want to take the next
question?
A - `Aamir Malik, Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President `
I can -- I'll speak quickly about Vyndamax in the U.S., and then touch on international too. In the
U.S., yes, we had a very strong quarter. We had 15% year-over-year growth. We maintainedmomentum and performance versus Q1, and there's a lot that's going on in this market right now.
So that performance is a function of improving diagnosis, as well as improving favorability
dynamics. So we continue to lead in the face of two competitors coming into that market, both in
terms of total market share, but also, importantly, lead in terms of first-line treatment-naive
patient share. So we've got good TRx momentum, and that's influenced the growth. Attruby is
taking some first-line share. And it's a little too early to tell about the dynamics of Amvuttra, and
we'll keep a close eye on that for the second half of the year.
Now, we do expect continued TRx volume growth, but there will be GTN pressure on U.S.
performance. And that's a function of both the Medicare Part D design, but also a result of
contracting to maintain access for Vynda, both in Medicare and commercial, where we've
maintained 90% access for the brand. So we do expect those dynamics to impact our sequential
growth in the back half of this year.
A - `Alexandre de Germay, Chief International Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President `
Yes. For international, so we have a very strong dynamic. So we have grown 32% for the quarter.
But actually, since the beginning of the year, we have grown our patients treated by 50%. So it's
clearly the -- what I was describing at the beginning in terms of focus on the key assets where we
think we can have an impact. This one is clearly the demonstration of our focus on execution.
Moving forward, we think we're going to continue to grow on this product for three reasons. First,
the diagnosis rate in international in most of our key markets is still significantly below what we
have in the U.S. and we normally see in this type of disease.
Two, the access. Access takes a lot of time in international. You need to negotiate price and
access in every single country, and it took us five years just to get to where we are, and
competition will have to follow the same timeline to get to the type of access that we get.
Just to illustrate my point is, we just unlocked U.K., and Australia at the end of last year, and we
just unlocked South Korea at the beginning of this quarter. So just to give you a sense of it takes
time, and now that we have access, we are unlocking the potential of those patients being
untreated.
And then finally, we think that the profile of our product and the experience of our key centers will
help us establish -- prepare [ph] to establish the standard of care that we have developed with
this asset. So we are very confident with the potential future growth of Vyndamax.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
And I'm very impressed with the performance of Vynda in international in the way that we were
not counting on that product before and now suddenly we see a very big thrive. We're not
counting in international, I mean, it was mainly U.S.
And let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to `Asad Haider, Goldman Sachs with Goldman Sachs.
Q - `Asad Haider, Goldman Sachs `
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Albert, just one more, if I may, on the policy front. Just
given the comments you just made, and then triangulating those back to your comments on MFN,that it's now quantified and reflected into guidance to some extent. Maybe just talk about what
could cause large swings to those expectations from here? Or is your high level view that we are
now getting more granular around a central and potentially narrower range of outcomes,
directionally speaking? Thank you.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Yes. Asad, I mean, our team is all over modeling several scenarios. There is no scenario that we
have not assessed. There is no scenario that we have not built mitigation plans. And there is no
scenario that we haven't assigned the probability of success. But the truth is, that we don't know
what will be, because all of that are right now under active discussion. So, even if I have some
ideas where we should increase probabilities of happening and where we should decrease
probabilities of happening, it's not appropriate now in the middle of the discussions and
negotiations. You don't open the cards, right? So I can't really do that.
Thank you. Next question.
Operator
We'll go next to `Umer Raffat, Evercore ISI with Evercore.
Q - `Umer Raffat, Evercore ISI `
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I'll spare the MFN question, but I did want to ask
Albert, I feel like some of the points you're making on this call regarding the China biotech
ecosystem could possibly resonate with the administration. But I guess how's -- and I'm not even
talking Pfizer specifically, but the industry broadly has been very active with a lot of out-licensing
transactions to find the next layer of innovation. So I guess, is administration pushing back with
sort of balancing those two?
And then separately, on your oncology side, I feel like this B6A trial in lung will obviously be very,
very important. And I was very intrigued to see that you shrunk the sample size from 670 down to
470, which presumably signals increased confidence. And my question is, did you take any interim
look to see how the effect size is tracking? Thank you very much.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Let me take the China one and then I ask Chris, of course, to comment on the oncology. Look, I
mean, there is a lot of sensitivity in the Senate and in the House, about everything that is
happening in China, right? But I have to say the sensitivity is way more on things that we transfer
there, technology that we transfer, then vice versa, things that we take from them to develop
them and manufacture them in the U.S. For example, our deal, I'm sure, but -- and I discussed the
Chinese deal that we did with members of the Congress, many members of the Congress, and I
explained that we didn't give anything.
We took their science and the license to develop it. We will do it globally, not in China, to
manufacture it. We will do it in the U.S., not in China, and to commercialize it. And we'll do it in the
whole world, and actually not in China yet because we don't have the rights yet. So I think less
sensitivity on these two ways, but don't take me wrong. China is something that is very high in the
radar of the political life of the U.S., and we need to be careful with that.
Now let's go, Chris.
A - `Chris Boshoff, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Research & Development `Thanks for the question, Umer. So usually for studies, we recalculate effect size or study size
based on emerging data from ongoing Phase 1/2 trials. We did not unblind, and there's no
unblinding of ongoing Phase 3 programs.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Okay. Thank you. Enough you saw -- I knew that you will not say much. So let's go to the next
question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to `Rajesh Kumar, HSBC with HSBC.
Q - `Rajesh Kumar, HSBC `
Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on, you said you'll absorb the potential
impact from the letters this year. Can you confirm that if there were tariffs, et cetera, you can say
the same about the next year as well? I know you don't have a guidance, but in terms of how
prepared you are with inventory, et cetera, and the pricing dynamics. Do you think current
consensus sort of captures the effect for the next year?
The second one is on the balance sheet. Clearly, you are going with a lower financial gearing
target, and, in effect, that gives you a bit more leeway on a lot of things. When you think of capital
allocation, do you think you need to add more types of assets in oncology? Or would most of the
balance sheet capacity be deployed in obesity, immunology, other areas? That is, if you have to
deploy capital in oncology, or, different indications or different mechanisms you still need to add,
then would you be comfortable going over the 2.7x leverage?
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you. Let's start with Dave, and then we will move to Andrew also.
A - `Dave Denton, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President `
Yes. So as it relates to future years '26 and '27, no, we can't -- we're not confirming or discussing
the implication of tariffs or MFN on those out years. Once we have definitive information and
knowledge, we'll come back and share that with everyone.
Secondly on -- just from a BD perspective, and others can comment on this as well, we have
lowered our target or improved our target to 2.7x because we are already at 2.7x. So it's hard to
have a target that we've exceeded so dramatically, because our business has done so well. And
if an opportunity were to come along that made sense for us from a BD perspective, obviously
we would outstrip the target, it would be higher, just like we did with Seagen, and we'd work to
get us back down to 2.7 over time. And to maybe to Albert's point earlier, from a BD perspective,
we're interested across the four areas in which we focus today, and we'll continue to evaluate
assets on the market in all of those four areas.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Andrew?
A - `Andrew Baum, Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, Executive Vice President `
Yes, I'd just add to Dave's comments. Look, I think every potential licensing deal or acquisition isactive through Seagen, and more recently 3SBio on oncology. However, as you know, Pfizer has a
strong commercial heritage with significant strength in areas such as internal medicine, I&I, and
obviously, we've got landmark drugs in those areas. So we believe we have a right to win. And if
the right opportunity comes up at the right price, you can be sure that we're going to pursue it.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to `Tim Anderson, Bank of America Securities with Bank of America.
Q - `Tim Anderson, Bank of America Securities `
Thank you. I have a question on IRA. So you guys have two drugs where prices are being
negotiated in the current year for implementation in '27. That's Ibrance and Xtandi. One fear that
at least we've had is that the new administration may press harder for bigger discounts versus
last year, potentially just to make a point in general, not just for Pfizer products. So you're in the
midst of those negotiations. Any color you can provide, such as how those discussions are lining
up with what you expected before those negotiations began?
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Look, as we said, we're in the middle of this negotiation. Again, for the same reason -- actually,
it's not allowed by law to disclose aspects of the negotiation. But I will say something. We have
two products, as you said, for '27. Both of them are losing patent on '27. So for us, of course, we
try to achieve the best we can in the negotiations of the prices. But the heat on us is very small.
The NPV is very small because it's really a few months of exclusivity. It depends on the product,
right? So next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to `Steve Scala, TD Cowen with TD Cowen.
Q - `Steve Scala, TD Cowen `
Thank you very much. Two questions. The first one, I apologize, is on MFN. You have quantified
the assumed impact of MFN in 2025, but you won't share your estimate. But I assume it's a big
number, well above $500 million for Q4 alone, and maybe several times that, which implies a
strikingly high number for 2026. And I'm just wondering whether you would walk that number
down. Second for Dave, you noted the positive underlying operational performance year to date.
You also noted the positive inflection in FX year to date. Curious how the COVID expectations
have changed. It seems they must have come down since revenue guidance is flat or unchanged
or something else in the business turned in a little bit late. Thank you.

Yes. Maybe on the COVID side, I don't know that our expectations at this moment have changed,
but we still have a lot yet to go in Q3 and Q4. So as I think about our future projections, we're still
internally working to achieve our number, but as my guidance reflects, we've now derisked some
of that delivery in Q3 and Q4.So I don't think anything has changed. We just know that COVID by itself, because of the nature
of that business, will always be a little bit more sensitive and a little bit more fluid and harder to
predict quarter-over-quarter. So this is just allowing us to derisk that a bit.
And then on the MFN perspective, we're not going to comment on those numbers at this point.
Thank you, though.

And the final question.

Our final question comes from `Terence Flynn, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC with Morgan Stanley.
Q - `Terence Flynn, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC `
Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two on the pipeline. Just for atirmociclib, was
wondering if we'll get an update from the Phase 2 study on PFS potentially at San Antonio later
this year. I know you've already committed moving into Phase 3, but I don't think we've seen
anything on durability there. And then on Lorbrena, any thoughts about exploring that in the
adjuvant setting? Thank you.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Chris?
A - `Chris Boshoff, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Research & Development `
Thank you for the question. So atirmociclib, you're correct. As we stated, we're focusing now on
the first line space and focusing with CAT6 [ph] for second line. We remain very confident in
atirmociclib on all the data we've seen. And the study, the first line trial in ER-positive, HER2
negative breast cancer. The study is recruiting extremely well, in fact, four times faster than we
actually planned or predicted. We've not disclosed the date when we will show the data on the
second line, but we'll keep you posted on that.
For lorlatinib, there's no current plan for an adjuvant study.
A - `Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer `
Thank you very much. Thank you for your attention. Just I want to say that I'm very pleased with
the execution of this team in terms of the targets that we have set. I would describe Pfizer right
now as a company with a very strong floor and no ceiling. And we plan to maintain the prudent
way of allocating capital, the focus on execution, the relentless focus on our pipeline productivity
and big assets, and improving our margins by the use of technology, focus and simplification of
our business process. Thank you very much and enjoy your summer to those that they didn't take
vacation, like me.
